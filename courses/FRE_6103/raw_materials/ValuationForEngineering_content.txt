Valuation for Financial Engineering   -- textbook by David C. Shimko
Preface and Chapter 1:  Valuation Methods for Financial Engineers
“Financial engineering” includes:
•Financial derivative security pricing, trading and risk models
•Financial risk models
•Financial product design and security structuring
•Corporate finance, including contingent capital structure and cash 
management decisions
1

Why are financial engineers needed?
•To apply the theory to solve practical problems their 
employers face based on particular circumstances .
2

Nearly every financial decision requires a valuation ; 
•but old models such as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or Price/ 
Earnings (P/E) ratios may be too simplistic for today’s complex cash flows.
Goal of the textbook and this course: 
 to teach financial engineers  (YOU) to apply valuation theory  
 to specific corporate and market circumstances .
What the general focus will / won’t  be:
•Discrete -time modeling, not continuous
•Simulation and flexible solutions, not closed -form solutions or formulas
3

We will approach valuation using a comprehensive simulation and benchmarking 
framework.   Benchmarks are based on traded assets or contract prices.
Example :
To value an oil refinery,
1.Build a stochastic pro -forma;
2.Simulate the cash flows;
3.Benchmark the cash flows to traded futures and option prices in energy;
4.Discount the cash flow components separately to reflect their different risks or 
benchmarks;
5.Determine a final valuation.
4

What types  of assets need to be valued?
•Capital assets  = financial instruments like stocks and bonds, having contractual or 
otherwise expected cash flows;
•Physical assets  = non -financial assets whose values derive from tangible cash flows 
that they produce (as opposed to intangible benefits);
•Derivatives  = contracts that may require little or no initial capital investment, but may 
become significant assets or liabilities over time;
▪One person’s asset = another person’s liability, so we must be able to value both assets 
AND liabilities;
•Corporate assets and liabilities  = assets whose values are determined in part by 
choices made at corporate headquarters such as:
oCapital budgeting decisions (when and how to invest);
oCapital structure decisions (how to finance the company);
oRisk management decisions (how to select and manage the company’s risk profile).
5

We’ll use the following general approach:
•We’ll focus on assets or contracts that produce cash flows with known probability 
distributions, or at least cash flows that can be stochastically defined or simulated. 
•These probability distributions may be altered within defined bounds at the asset 
manager’s discretion to maximize their values. 
•We’ll assume the risk -free term structure is known. 
•Our goal will be to value any cash flow that can be defined stochastically. 
•We’ll determine risk adjustments to discount rates based on market benchmarks, 
or alternatively we’ll deduct risk charges first in order to discount cash flows at the 
risk-free rate.
Don’t worry, each component will be discussed in much more detail!
6

This course will proceed as follows:
•Part I:  Valuation problems when discount rates (including 
any risk adjustments) are known. 
•Part II:  Methods for valuing cash flows when the risk 
adjustments are unknown ahead of time.
•Part III:  Valuation of corporate assets and liabilities.

8Asset types:
Intangible Assets  
 Capital Assets    
 Tangible Assets
•Intangible assets (for example, a company brand)
•Capital assets (for example, a share of stock) 
•Tangible assets (for example, a company building)

9Common types of capital assets :
Share of stock = % ownership share which entitles shareholders to 
1.Any appreciation in price of the corporation (“capital gain”)
2.Corporate payouts to shareholders (“dividends”)
Bond = claim to
1.Interest payments (“coupons”)
2.Any capital gains
3.Scheduled principal payments
Real estate = claim to
1.Rental payments
2.Any capital gains

10Can a dairy cow be considered as a capital asset? 
 
•What might the cash flows be?  
•Capital gains?

11The valuation of assets can be affected by their circumstances:
•Limited liability = legal protection against claims that exceed the 
value of corporate assets
•Bankruptcy  = right to default on debt by surrendering assets to 
debtholders for whatever the assets are worth
•Tax incentives , such as the tax deductibility of interest paid on debt 
issued by corporations, which increase net cash flows to the firm

12Therefore, in sum:
Limited liability
Bankruptcy protection
Tax incentivesIncreased
Value
of Company
Shareholders never lose more than they invest, so they benefit from 
limited liability also!

13Contracts can be thought of as “contingent assets”
 They commit the parties to actions that may create value for all, 
 or destroy values for one party or the other, over time.
For example, 
•A farmer commits to a forward contract to sell wheat in the future for $4 
per bushel, 
•but the market price increases to $5, 
•he faces an opportunity loss of $1 per bushel, and the value of the 
contract is negative  to himEven if contracts have no value at inception, 
they may end up destroying value for one party over time, in which 
case the contract value to that party would be negative. 

14Additional Terminology
Ask price = price offered by the seller
Bid price = price offered by the buyer
•A market order to buy on an exchange will be executed at the ask price  
•A market order to sell on an exchange will be executed at the bid price  
•But keep in mind, the value  of an asset might differ significantly from its price . 
•In addition, the public value  of an asset may differ significantly from it’s 
private value . 
―You should only buy an asset if your private valuation is greater than the 
public valuation.
―You should only sell an asset if you private valuation is less than the public 
valuation.

15In sum, IT’S VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT:
•The value of an asset is NOT a simple calculation. 
•It is the result of a MODEL, based on ASSUMPTIONS.

16Some useful valuation models:
1. Liquidation value
How much the highest available bidder will pay for an asset at this time
2. Replacement cost
How much it would cost to reconstruct the asset
3. Comparable value
The value of similar assets, with possible valuation adjustments for imperfect 
matches (e.g. similar properties in real estate)
4. Benchmark Valuation 
Similar to comparables , but allows a wide range of assets and contracts to be 
used to replicate the cash flows of the asset as well as possible, using 
securities and assets whose prices are known. 
5. Net present value
The current value of future cash flows and liquidation value created by an 
asset
6. Portfolio value
The increase in the value of a company as a result of the addition of the asset.
We will focus on #5 and #6 in this class.

17Key points about valuation models:
•Most widely used valuation methods in accounting valuations are replacement 
cost and comparable value due to verifiability
•Financial valuations tend to be more subjective and private
•Benchmark valuation of Amazon stock might use portfolio of retail and tech 
stocks that best match Amazon’s projected earnings
•Portfolio valuation important if all parties don’t value an asset in the same way

18For our purposes,
•“Asset” = anything that creates cash flows and capital appreciation/depreciation. 
•“Total return” = incremental net benefit produced by asset over a period of time. 
•Cash flows can be positive or negative.  Positive means we receive  money (good 
guy), negative means we pay money (bad guy).
•“Capital gain” = change in asset value = appreciation  or depreciation  over time.  
(We will often refer to a negative capital gain as a “capital loss.”)

19Rate Definitions :
Present Value (PV) = Value of CFs occurring at different times in the future
Future Value (FV) = Value of CFs at a fixed future date
Time value of money = % rate of change in value of riskless CFs over time
Rate of return (ROR)  = Growth rate of asset or portfolio over time (expected or actual)
Capital gain rate = change in price, note it is only one component of total return
Total return (ROR) = capital gains AND cash payments, m/b expressed in $ or as a %
Growth rate = change in CFs over time (≠ ROR)
Default rate = likelihood CFs won’t materialize due to bankruptcy or other failure

20•Suppose you purchased a share of Walmart for $70 one year ago, expecting it would 
pay a $1.00 dividend and appreciate in value by $6.00 by now.  
•Then, it actually paid $0.50 in dividends and appreciated by $10 in value. 
•Then we could say any and all of the following:
•The expected one-year total dollar return was ????? one year ago
•The expected one-year capital gain was ????? one year ago 
•The expected dividend was ????? one year ago
•The realized one-year total dollar return was ?????
•The realized one-year capital gain was ?????
•The realized one-year dividend was ?????
•Note however that all of these can be answered in dollars or percentages!Answer 
these 
questions 
in dollars.Prices, Returns, Expectations and Realizations

Required and Expected Returns
21•Why do investors require a minimum level of 
returns?
•Foregone time value
•For giving up cash, investors must be 
compensated the interest (r) they 
would have earned in a risk -free 
investment of equal initial value (V0)
•Incurred risk cost
•For taking the risk of loss, investors 
must earn additional compensation
•This is typically computed by 
assuming a risk measure ( ) and 
multiplying by a cost per unit risk (k)
•In sum, investors require compensation for lost 
time value and incremental risk cost.What returns do investors expect to earn from 
an investment over the next time period?
Capital gains
This is the change in the value of the 
investment, (V1-V0), whether they sell it or 
not
Cash flows
This refers to cash income (C) earned from 
the investment, e.g. stock dividends, bond 
coupons or other payments
In sum, investors earn returns through capital 
gains or cash flow, and only care about the sum.

This key relationship determines pricing:
22•What is the required total dollar return on an asset (two components)?
Return on Cash + Compensation for Risk
•What is the expected dollar return on an asset (two components)?
Expected Gains + Expected Cash Flows
•What is the relationship between required and expected return for a buyer of an asset?
Required Return ≤Expected Return
•What is the relationship between required and expected return for a seller of an asset?
Required Return ≥Expected Return
•How do you reconcile these two equations?
Required Return = Expected Return

23In sum,
Required Return  = Return on Cash + Compensation for Risk 
Expected Return  = Expected Gains + Expected Cash Flows
A buyer demands:     Required Return ≤ Expected Return
A seller demands:     Required Return ≥ Expected Return
To reach equilibrium:  Required Return = Expected Return

The GVE, or General Valuation Equation
24•GVE:  Required return = Expected return
•Required return = Compensation for time plus compensation  for risk
•Expected return = Expected capital gains plus cash flows
•Notation
•r = risk -free interest rate
•C1= cash flow at time 1
•V0= valuation at time 0
•V1= valuation at time 1
•= standard deviation (an example of a risk measure, to be explained later)
•k = compensation per unit risk
•Can you write the GVE using this notation?
𝑟𝑉0+𝑘𝜎=E𝑉1−𝑉0+𝐸[𝐶1]
Key takeaway :  Because the components of the GVE are functions of the value, we can solve for the 
value V0that makes the equation hold

Exercise
25•Use the GVE to find the formula to value a single guaranteed (zero risk) cash flow 
in one year
•Reminder
•r = risk -free rate
•Also called the discount rate when finding present value
•C1= cash flow at time 1
•V0= valuation at time 0
•= a risk measure
•k = compensation per unit riskGVE reminder
𝑟𝑉0+𝑘𝜎=E𝑉1−𝑉0+𝐸[𝐶1]

26Goal is to determine V0
Required Return = time value of money + compensation for risk
  = risk -free opportunity cost of funds + compensation for risk
  = r V0 + 0
Expected Return = expected capital gain (CG) + expected cash flow (CF)
  = (0 - V0) + C
or  = (C - V0) + 0  (i.e., there are two ways of characterizing the transaction)
Required Retirn  = Expected Return
  r V0  + 0 = (C - V0) + 0
  r V0  = C - V0
   (1+r) V0  = C 
  V0 = C/(1+r)

When returns are undefined
27•If you bought a stock for $50 and sold for $60, what was the return?
•DOLLARS ___________ PERCENT _____________
•A short sale requires the following sequence:
•Borrow the stock
•Sell it
•Buy it back later, hopefully at a lower price (thereby earning a profit)
•Return the stock to the owner
•If you sold the stock short at $50 and later repurchased it for $40, 
what was the return?
•DOLLARS ___________ PERCENT _____________
•What is the percentage return on the short sale of a stock you sold at $50 and bought back at $40?
•Impossible to compute!
•We have the same problem with futures trades and short option trades
This illustrates the necessity of being able to measure returns and risk in dollars, not percentages!

28Another example:
Forward contract to buy a barrel of oil in one year at $50
    (I.e., the one -year forward price is $50)
Suppose the actual price after one year is $51
    Profit = $1
    But % return = $1 / $0   Undefined!
Conclusion :
Can use % returns for assets that are purchased and paid for in cash and have limited 
liability protection, such as long  positions in stocks and bonds
For short  positions and forward contracts, must analyze in terms of “dollarized”   
returns, not % returns

When returns are undefined, cont’d
29An alternative way of analyzing short sales:
•Same example:  Assume you sold the stock short at $50 and later repurchased it for $40, 
What was the dollar return and percent return?
•For this short sale, one can reason as follows:
•Initial investment = -$50 (because you receive this amount by borrowing the stock)
•Ending cash flow = -$40 (because you pay this amount by returning the stock to the owner)
•Hence the dollar return = ( -$40) –(-$50) = $10 (we already knew this intuitively)
•And the percentage return = dollar return/initial investment = ($10)/( -$50) = -20%
•Note that from this perspective, shorting converts a negative percentage return into a positive dollar 
return, because the original investment is negative:
•Dollar return = %return x initial investment = ( -20%) x ( -$50) = $10
•This alternative treatment of short transactions, while correct and sometimes useful, might seem a 
little strange because there’s no initial investment like there is in long transactions.
•Also note this alternative treatment wouldn’t work (i.e., still wouldn’t produce a meaningful 
percentage return) for a forward transaction/contract .

30Power and generality of the Generalized Valuation Equation :
GVE can be used to value:
•Stocks and bonds (capital assets)
•Annuities and perpetuities
•Structured debt products
•Risky cash flows
•Futures and forward contracts
•Options and real options
•Corporate assets and liabilities
Special cases of GVE:
•Benchmarking models for equity
•Modigliani -Miller proposition
•Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
•Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing differential equation
Stay tuned!!!

31A little more on valuing liabilities …. Insurance interlude:
“Valuation” for insurance companies frequently means “calculation of 
reserves.”
Reserve = “something kept back or saved for future use”
 = PV future benefits & expenses – PV future premiums

32Purposes of reserves:
1.To maintain company solvency (“statutory or solvency 
reserves”)
2.To help determine company earnings for financial reporting 
(“earnings or GAAP reserves”)
3.To help determine company taxable earnings (“tax reserves”)

33It is necessary for insurance companies to hold reserves if premiums 
exceed benefits in early years but not in later years
Extremely Simplistic Hypothetical Example – 3 Year Term Policy
Expected
Premium Benefits Reserve
BOY MOY EOY
0 0
1 100 50 50
2 100 100 50
3 100 150 0
∑ 300 300

34At any given point in time, reserves can be calculated in two ways:
We can look backwards and compare the accumulated value of premiums 
received minus the accumulated value of benefits and expenses paid out;
We can look forwards and compare the present value of benefits and expenses 
we expect to pay out in the future to the present values of premiums we expect 
to receive.
Under certain conditions, the two amounts will be equal.
Actual reserve methods must comply with insurance laws, regulations, 
accounting & tax rules.

35Key takeaways from insurance interlude :
Valuation of liabilities and of assets are both very important.
Present values and future values are focused on a particular point in time
In order to  compare varying cash flows, one discounts or accumulates them to the 
same point in time
It’s extremely important to be clear about the specific point in time you are using 
and not lose sight of it .

Valuation for Financial Engineering   -- textbook by David C. Shimko
Chapter 2:  Annuities and Perpetuities, Basic and Complex
“Annuity”   = sequence of equally spaced payments
“Perpetuity”    = annuity that goes on forever
“Deferred annuity” = annuity that starts in the future
1

Notation
i = floating point in time ( i = 0 for now)
s = fixed point in time
n = date of final payment, also in some cases, the number of payments
r = risk -free rate of interest, simple annual, or interpreted as a given discount rate
C = amount of a single cash flow CF, or a constant CF
Ci = cash flow on a particular date i
g = percentage growth rate in cash flow over a period, e.g. C2 = C1(1+g)
b = fixed dollar increase in CF per period, e.g. C2 = C1 + b
µ = long -run mean (asymptotic) cash payment
ҡ = speed of reversion of cash flow to long -run mean per period; the expected percentage movement 
toward the long -run mean in one period
Vi = valuation of a financial instrument as of date i, so V0 = value today
V1 -- V0 = the capital gain on an asset over one period, after CFs have occurred
2

Functions you will create later in the chapter in Excel or Python
 
•PVA (C, n, r, Vn, s) = PV of flat annuity of n equally spaced payments of C, discount rate = r. 
Vn = maturity value in addition to last payment of C (if any), s = starting date of the first 
payment of C. 
•PVGA (C1, n, r, g, Vn, s) = PV of annuity whose CFs grow at rate g,  C1 = first payment
•PVLGP (a, b, r, s) = PV of linearly growing perpetuity, b = fixed dollar increase in CFs. CFt = 
a + bt, first payment CFs = a + bs. 
•PVLGA (a, b, n, r, s) = PV of linearly growing annuity, n = # of payments, b = fixed dollar 
increase in CFs.   CF = a + bt at time t, first payment = a + bs, last payment a + bn. 
•PVMRA (C1, ҡ, µ, n,r,s) = PV of mean -reverting annuity, µ =  long -run mean cash flow, ҡ = 
mean -reverting speed 
3

Single Risk -Free CF at Any Future Date
Strategy:  Use “back sweep” method and GVE
GVE:  Required Return = Expected CG + Expected CF
“Back Sweep” Method:  Start at the end date (“maturity date”) and 
work backwards
Suppose the payment date = 2 years from today ( i = 2)
4

•At time 2:  V2 = C2
•At time 1:  r V1  = (0 – V1) + C2
  r V1  = C2 – V1
   (1+r) V1  = C2 
  V1 = C2/(1+r)
•At time 0:  r V0  = (V1 – V0) + 0
  r V0  = V1 – V0
   (1+r) V0  = V1 
  V0 = V1/(1+r)
•Therefore, V0 = C2 /(1+r)2

6Suppose the payment date = i is greater than 2 years from today  
From induction it follows that
0(1 )i
iCVr+=
Moreover,  PV of sum of CFs = sum of PVs of individual CFs
Therefore, 
10(1 )i

7Example:  Legal settlement of $2 million in 3 years, discount rate of 5%.  
What is the value today?
3$2,000,000
(1.05)PV=
$1,727,675.20=
If someone offers you $1.5 million today in exchange for the settlement in  3 
years, should you take it?
•If having cash today is worth more to you than the difference 
($227,675.20), take it.  
•Otherwise, don’t.

8Remember from Chapter 1:
The “Net Present Value” model is only one valuation model!
Note:  The NPV model is also sometimes called the “Discounted Cash Flow” model.

9Valuing a Perpetuity
•Remember, 
 “Perpetuity”  = annuity that goes on forever
•Includes debt obligations with no specified maturity date, such as preferred stock.
Traditional method of finding PV:
10(1 )i
iVrC
=+=
1(1lim)n
iniC
r→==+
11
(1lim)n

inCr→==+

10If we let 
1
(1 )vr=+
we can write this as
1limn
ni
iCv
→==
lim
nCS
→=
where 
1 2 3...nS v v v v= + + + +

11Multiplying through by v, we get
2 3 4 1...nvS v v v v+= + + + +
And now subtracting vS from S, all but the first and last terms cancel, and we have
11(1 )nS v v v+− = −
11
1nvvSv+−=−
Dividing the numerator and denominator by 
1
(1 )vr=+
1
11nvSr−=+−
1nv
r−=

12The quantity
1 2 3...nS v v v v= + + + +
is the PV of an annuity of $1 paid at the end of each year for n years, which is 
sometimes symbolized by 
1 2 3...
nna v v v v= + + + +
This implies that the formula for the PV of an annuity of $1 paid at the end of 
each year for n years is
1
nnvar−=

13So going back to the original problem of valuing a perpetuity of amount “C,” we’ve seen
10(1 )i
iVrC
=+=
1limn
ni
iCv
→==
1limn
nvCr→−=
But since 
11
(1 )vr=+ If the risk free interest rate  
0r ,   we can see that
 
lim 0n
nv
→=

14so we have the value of the perpetuity is
0CVr=
Note:  The PV of an annuity of $1 paid at the end of each year forever (i.e., of a 
perpetuity) is sometimes symbolized by 
1 2 3... a v v v= + + +
Thus we also have
1ar=

15In some cases, you might find it helpful to value cash flows by simply writing out the terms.
1 2 3... S v v v= + + +
234... vS v v v= + +
(1 )v S v−=
1vSv=−
1
(1/ ) 1Sv=−
1
(1 ) 1Sr=+−
1Sr=
However, in taking these shortcuts it’s very important to pay close attention to:
1.the timing of the cash flows relative to the point at which you’re valuing them!
2.whether infinite series are convergent! 

16Now let’s use the GVE to value the perpetuity!
GVE:  Required Return = Expected CG + Expected CF
But for a perpetuity paying C every year, 
No matter when you choose to value it, the future cash flows are the same!  Therefore
0 1 2   V V V= = = 
Hence there are no capital gains! 
()0 1 0        –    r V V V C=+
0 0  rV C=+
0  CVr=

17Example:
•You expect a real estate investment to produce $100,000 per year net return 
forever, and your discount rate for real estate is 4% per year
•What is the private value of your investment? 
0$100,000  .04V=
$2,500,000=
•If the market value is $3,000,000, should you sell the property? 
•Yes, if you can invest $3,000,000 at 4% producing income of $120,000 per 
year, assuming ….
oThe investment has similar risk
oThere are no other subjective factors

18Valuing an Annuity
Recall that we introduced the notation from the text PVA (C, n, r, Vn, s)
PVA (C, n, r, Vn, s) = PV of flat annuity of n equally spaced payments of C, discount rate = 
r. Vn = maturity value in addition to last payment of C (if any), s = starting date of the 
first payment of C. 
Assuming that the payments start in one year from now, and that there is no additional 
maturity value Vn, the symbol for the present value would be PVA (C, n, r, 0, 1)
We already saw that the formula for the PV of an annuity of $1 paid at the end of each 
year for n years is
1
nnvar−=
Therefore, the PV of annual payments of amount C beginning one year from now is simply
( )()  ,  ,  , ,  1 1  0nPCr vrVA C n =−

19An annuity can also be valued as the difference in value between two perpetuities:
(1 )n CVvr=−

20Now let’s use the GVE to value the annuity!
Required Return = Expected CG + Expected CF
Time value of money + Risk compensation = Expected CG + Expected CF
()0 1 0  0     –    r V V V C+ = +
23
0 ...nV vC v C v C v C= + + + +

1 ...nV vC v C v C v C−= + + + +
Thus the capital gain is

And the GVE implies

A Simple Paradigm for Common Cash Flow Patterns
•Many cash flow patterns can be modeled as a 
growing annuity with a final payment
•Once you know 5 of the 6 inputs, the missing 
value can be determined
•Some details:
•Make sure the period is consistent with 
the parameter (n, r)
•The first payment occurs in one period
•The PV is often expressed as a negative 
number, as if it is an investment that 
receives positive cash flows
•The FV is the amount received in addition 
to the final payment
•g is the percentage growth rate in the cash 
flow per period
•On some financial calculators, r 
(sometimes denoted by i) is expressed as a 
% rather than a decimal

27Valuing a Simplified Bond
The issuer of a simplified bond receives a loan of “F” in return for promising to
•make annual interest payments of amount “C”;
•repay “F” at the end of the n -year term
F is sometimes called the face value, maturity value or principal of the bond.
The present value (PV) is the sum of an n -year annuity and the final payment:
0nnV Ca Fv=+
1n
n vC Fvr−=+
where

1vr=+

28Example:
Suppose the coupon rate is 5% (this is the rate of interest that the bond issuer promises to pay).
If the principal is $1,000, the coupon would be 5% x $1,000 = $50.
What is the PV of the bond if the term is 10 years and the discount rate is 4%, 5% or 6%?
At 4%, V0 = $1,081.11   At 5%, V0 = $1,000.00   At 6%, V0 =    $926.40
From this we see the following implications of the coupon rate versus the discount rate:
•coupon rate greater than discount rate  value greater than face amount;
•coupon rate equal to discount rate  value equal face amount;
•coupon rate less than discount rate  value less than face amount.
Conversely, we can see the following implications of the value versus the face amount:
•value less than face amount  discount rate greater than coupon rate;
•value equal to face amount  discount rate equal to coupon rate;
•value greater than face amount  discount rate less than coupon rate.

29It’s easy to see that this is true in general.  For example, assume the coupon rate = the 
discount rate r;

30Terminology:
•If you are an investor who purchases a bond at its face value F, you are said to 
be buying the bond “ at par value ” or “ at par, ”   
•If you pay more than the face value you are said to be buying the bond “ at a 
premium ,” and your yield will be less than the coupon rate .  
•If you pay less than the face value you are said to be be buying the bond “ at a 
discount ,” and your yield will be more than the coupon rate .  
•The market price of a bond may be above or below par, depending on factors 
such as the general level of interest rates that investors can earn on other 
investments and the bond issuer’s credit status.

31In addition, looking more closely at the changes in the present value of the bond if 
the discount rate is 4%, 5% or 6%, we see the following pattern as the discount rate 
increases:
At 4%, V0 = $1,081.11
At 5%, V0 = $1,000.00;   = -$81.11
At 6%, V0 =    $926.40;   = -$73.60
This shows that bond prices are “convex in the discount rate.”  
That is, they decrease in value at a decreasing rate as interest rates rise.

32To demonstrate convexity (i.e., that prices are concave up), one can show that if

34Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)
ZCBs are bonds that pay no coupons.  
Examples are U.S. government T -bills and STRIPs.
If 
•t = time to maturity 
•r(t) = discount rate for maturity at time t
•F = face value
then
0(1 )tFVr=+
Why are ZCBs important  ??
Because we can use ZCBs to value CFs with different discount rates for different maturities!

35Valuing a Growing Perpetuity
Recall that
•g = percentage growth rate in cash flow over a period, e.g. C2 = C1(1+g)
•PVGP (C1, r, g, s=1) = PV of perpetuity whose CFs grow at rate g,  C1 = first payment

39Valuing a Growing Annuity
PVGA (C1, n, r, g, Vn, s) = PV of annuity whose first payment is C1, n equally spaced 
payments, discount rate = r. g = growth rate, Vn = maturity value in addition to last 
payment (if any), s = starting date of the first payment.   Typically, Vn = 0 and s = 1, i.e., 
we will value PVGA (C1, n, r, g, 0, 1).
As was the case with the growing perpetuity, the brute force method makes it clear that 
the increasing annuity:
can also be viewed as a flat annuity of amount C0, by substituting

45Example: 
Same example as before, but now adding a 2% inflation adjustment:
•Your client has been in an automobile accident and was awarded $50,000 per 
year growing at 2% per year  for 25 years as a settlement, starting in one year. 
•If his discount rate is 8%, what is the present value of the settlement? 
C = 50,000  s = 1 n = 25    r = 8%     g = 2%
PVGA (C1, n, r, g, Vn, s) = PVGA (50,000, 25, .08, .02, 0, 1)

Note:  You could also handle this problem as a flat annuity, with

PVA (C, n, r, Vn, s) = PVA ( 49,019.61 , 25, .0588235, 0, 1)

48Advanced Annuities:  Linear Growth
Example:  A broker receives annually decreasing compensation for introducing a client to a bank:
$100 initally , $80 at eoy 1, $60 at eoy 2, $40 at eoy 3, $20 at eoy 4, $0 at eoy 5 and later.
Start with an increasing perpetuity that pays $1 at eoy 1, $2 at eoy 2, $3 at eoy 3, etc.
The actuarial symbol for this perpetuity is
2 3 4( ) 2 3 4 ...= + + + + Ia v v v v

49Brute force method:
As shown in Dr. Shimko’s  textbook, you can picture the cash flows as follows:
= The first row has  P a V
= The second row has  PV v a
=2The third row has  PV v a
etc., etc., so the total present value can be viewed as a “perpetuity of perpetuities”:

51More general case:  Perpetuity paying a + bt at unit intervals (we’ll assume years for 
now), starting at time s:
PVLGP (a, b, r, s) = PV at time 0 of a linearly growing perpetuity, b = fixed dollar increase 
in CFs. CFt = a + bt, first payment CFs = a + bs. 
payment                 a+bs     a+b(s+1)    a+b(s+2)    a+b(s+3)    a+b(s+4)    a+b(s+5) … etc. 
 
time s-1 s s+1 s+2 s+3 s+4 s+5 
We can decompose these payments into a level perpetuity and an increasing perpetuity:
level perpetu ity               a+bs         a+bs           a+bs         a+bs           a+bs          a+bs    …  etc.

53Now that we’ve covered the perpetuity, we can discuss the corresponding linearly 
growing annuity:
PVLGA (a, b, n, r, s) = PV of linearly growing annuity, n = # of payments, b = fixed dollar 
increase in CFs.   CF = a + bt at time t, first payment = a + bs, last payment a + bn. 
PVLGA (a, b, n, r, s) can then be valued as the difference between two perpetuities, with 
at least one of them deferred. 
For example, if the annuity payment starts at time 1 and ends at n, we have 
payment                 a+b           a+2b          a+3b         …              a+nb       a+(n+1) b … etc. 
 
time 0 1 2 3 … n n+1    …  etc. 
PVLGA (a, b, n, r, s) = PVLGP (a, b, r, 1) − PVLGP (a, b, r, n+1)
Important note:  As with geometrically growing annuities, it may be helpful to define
    C0 = C1 – b = (a + b) – b = a
so that the payment at time 1 equals the desired C1.

54Example: A business expects to bring in one client per year for the next 15 years. If 
each client is worth $50,000 per year in perpetuity, and the discount rate is 12%, what 
is the value of this program? 
First draw a picture of the cash flows you are trying to value!

Next calculate the PV at time 0 of the increasing annuity during the first 15 years:

56Advanced Annuities:  Mean Reversion
In some markets, prices follow mean -reverting patterns
•Interest rates, commodities, foreign exchange
•Mean -reverting prices exhibit exponential decay to a long -run mean value ( 𝜇)
•This means if the spot price today is S0, then the price next period satisfies the 
following equation:
o (S1 - 𝜇 ) = (1 – 𝜅) (S0 – 𝜇)
•More generally, the spot price at time t satisfies
o (St - 𝜇 ) = (1 – 𝜅)t (S0 – 𝜇)
o𝜅 is the speed of mean reversion of St to 𝜇, i.e. the percentage of the distance in 
the direction of the long run mean
•Mean reversion implies that low prices will be expected to rise, and high prices will be 
expected to fall in the future
•The term captures exponential decay to the long -run mean

57
•Rearranging terms, 
oSt  = 𝜇  +  (1 – 𝜅)t (S0 – 𝜇)
•This implies that the spot prices can be looked at as the sum of 
oa fixed cash flow 𝜇, plus
oan exponentially growing cash flow with starting value C1  = (1 – 𝜅)1 (S0 – 𝜇), 
growth rate – 𝜅, and Ct+1 = (1 – 𝜅)Ct 
•Recall the symbol PVMRA (C1, ҡ, µ, n,r,s) = PV of mean -reverting annuity, µ =  long -
run mean cash flow, ҡ = mean -reverting speed 
•Therefore, PVMRA (C1, ҡ, µ,n,r,1) = PVA (µ, n, r, 0, 1) + PVGA (C1, n, r, – 𝜅, 0, 1)

58Example:
•The current price of corn is $3.50 a bushel, and the long run mean is $5 a bushel.
•The annual speed of mean reversion is 10%, and the discount rate is 5%.
•What is the present value of 20 annual payments starting one year from now, 
with each payment equal to the future price of 1 million bushels of corn?
Cash flows for each single bushel produced:
S0 = 3.50
S1 = (1 - .10)(3.50 – 5) + 5 = 3.65
S2 = (1 - .10)2(3.50 – 5) + 5 = 3.785
S3 = (1 - .10)3(3.50 – 5) + 5 = 3.90650

11Valuation for Financial Engineering --textbook by David C. Shimko
Chapter 3:  Complications and Resolutions
Simplifying assumptions that we made in Chapter 2:
1. Interest is compounded 1x per period,
first CF occurs in 1 period, 
CFs are fixed in dollars
2. CFs are unaffected by inflation or taxes;
3. CFs are unaffected by default of payer, death of receiver, or early termination
Some real world cash flow and rate complications that we’ll discuss in Ch. 3:
Payment frequency
Fixed income terminology
Different interest rates
By time period in a single currency
By foreign currency and time
Inflation, real and nominal rates of interest
Taxes, pretax and after tax yields
Loan amortization and APR

23Debt instrument payment frequencies:
Monthly –consumer loans
Quarterly (i.e., every 3 months) –some corporate bonds
Semiannually (i.e., every 6 months)  –some corporate bonds and all US 
government bonds
4Converting simple annual rates to periodic rates
Default:  r = simple annual (risk-free) interest rate
Periodic rate:
•m = number of discounting periods per year
•Periodic rate = simple annual rate / m
“Simple”:  To get the annual rate you “simply” multiply the periodic rate by the 
number of periods (there is no compounding), and vice-versa
“Compounding”:  Interest being paid on interest.
Effective annual rate: The interest rate you actually earn or pay in a year when 
interest is compounded more than once per year.
•Note:  The EAR is useful in comparing the yields on instruments with different 
payment frequencies.3

35Examples:
If the simple annual rate (SAR) of 8% is compounded quarterly; what is the 
effective annual rate (EAR)?
“simple annual” means the rate paid in each quarter is 8%/4 = 2%
If interest is compounded quarterly, the accumulated value of $1 at the end 
of the year will be $1 x (1.02)4= 1.082432160
This implies that the EAR is 8.24%
If the EAR = 12.55% is payable quarterly, what is the SAR?  Reverse the steps:
The accumulated value of $1 at the end of the year is $1 x (1.1255)
The accumulation factor per quarter is therefore (1.1255)1/4= 1.029997984
This means that the rate paid in each quarter (SAR/4) is 2.9997984%
Hence SAR = 4 x 2.9997984% = 12.00%
6In summary, the fundamental equation relating EAR to SAR payable m-thly is:

This implies that the accumulation factor for t years at an annual interest rate r compounded

and the discount factor for t years at rate at annual interest rate r compounded continuously is

Thus, the PV at time 0 of any cash flow Ctpaid at time t discounted continuously at simple

12You can therefore think of the discount factor for interest compounded continuously 
as the analogue to the discount factor vtfor interest compounded annually

Note: In some applications, the effective annual rate may be denoted by “r” instead of

denote the continuously discounted rate (in place of “r”):

14Why is the “continuously compounded discount rate” corresponding to an effective 
annual rate of r also called the “force of interest” corresponding to r?
Consider a fund of $1,000 invested at time 0 at an effective annual interest rate of r, and 
suppose we want to measure the intensity or “force” with which interest operates on the 
fund at any given time t.
( ) $1,000(1 )tF t r 
We could try measuring the force (t) with which interest is operating at time t by 
taking the derivative of the fund value at time t, since the derivative is one measure of 
the rate of change at time t.  That is, we could try defining the force of interest as
( ) $1,000 (1 )t d dF t rdt dt 
$1,000 exp log(1 )dt rdt 
$1,000log(1 )(1 )tr r   13
14

2/25/2025
815The problem with defining (t) this way is that it would mean that the intensity with which 
interest is operating on a fund depends on the starting value.  
That is, it would mean that interest will operate on a fund starting at $2,000 with twice the 
intensity as it will on a fund starting at $1,000, which isn’t true.  To solve this we “normalize” 
by dividing by the fund value at time t.  
( )$1,000(1 ) log(1 )we divide by ( ):                       ( )( ) $1,000(1 )t

log(1 )r 
This shows that the force of interest (t) at time t is actually a constant , and that it’s 
equal to log(1+r), consistent with our previous observations!

917Payment Frequency and Discounting Frequency
Key point:  When you encounter problems with payment frequency ≠discounting 
frequency, first find the discount rate for the payment frequency!
For example, if the interest rate on a consumer loan is quoted on a simple annual 
basis, but the payments are made on a monthly basis, first divide the simple annual 
rate by 12.
Numerical Example:
Biennial payments of $10,000 starting in 1 year, repeating every 2 years for 5 
payments.  Simple annual discount rate is 8%.  What is the present value today?
Draw a picture:
18payment                               $10,000         $0              …              $0       $10,000 
time -1 0 1 2 … 8 9     
Clearly this is a level annuity with 5 payments of amount $10,000 every 2 years 
starting not from t = 0 but from t = -1.  We can therefore use the formula for a level 
annuity with 5 payments:
5
1 5110,000 10,000vPV ar     
The first step in doing the computation is to find the discount rate for the payment 
frequency (2 years).  Set the accumulation factor 1+r = 1.082r = 1.082–1 = 16.64% 
= biennial rate.17

5111.166410,000 32,260.01.1664    
Are we finished?  NO!  Because we want the PV TODAY (t = 0), not the PV a year ago (t = -1).
To find PV0, we simply accumulatePV-1to get the value at time t = 0:
 0 1 1.08 32,260.01 (1.08) 34,840.81 PV PV  
20For monthly, quarterly or semi-annual payments, usually you must take the quoted 
simple annual rate SAR and divide by the number of compounding periods (ignoring 
the effects of compound interest) and convert to the effective annual rate (EAR) 
considering the effect of compounding:
1+𝐸𝐴𝑅=1+𝑆𝐴𝑅

        with 𝑚=  compounding frequency19

11Inflation
21•Just like interest rates change, so do inflation rates
•Inflation implies the spending power of our money 
shrinks (proportionately) as inflation increases
•But it is not always bad!
•Therefore money can be described in two ways:
•Nominal dollars:  The actual amount of dollars 
we have
•Real dollars:  What those dollars are worth in 
spending power terms, usually in reference to 
a prior year
•The return on money is also expressed in two 
ways:
•Nominal return:  Contractual return or actual 
return measured in currency
•Real return:  Adjusted downward for inflationProblem:
Suppose I receive a fixed wage 
contract
Although I know the payment, I 
don’t know future spending power
I could get a wage contract adjusted 
for inflation 
This is called a COLA clause, or 
cost of living adjustment
But inflation changes
How can I value this contract?

If the nominal risk-free interest rate r = 5%, but the inflation rate is 2%; how 
fast does the real spending power of a risk-free investment increase?
Answer:  The real spending power increases by r –i= 5% -2% = 3% per year.

1631Key Takeaway:
•Always discount nominal CFs at nominal interest rates !
•Always discount real CFs at real interest rates !
Also important:
•Even if future inflation rates are unknown, it may be reasonable in 
some situations (such as the COLA annuity) to assume that the 
nominal CFs grow with inflation.
•In this case the real CFs will be the same in every year and can be 
valued as a level annuity at the estimated real interest rate .
32Example:
C0= base salary = $100,000.  3-year employment contract with COLA clause.  
Estimated annual inflation rate based on CPI = 2%.  r = nominal rate of interest = 4.5%. 
What is the present value of the contract?
Strategy:  Discount the real CFs of level amount C0at the real interest rate , using the 
formula for a level annuity

1733Taxes
Rule of thumb:  
Always discount pre-tax CFs at pre-tax interest rates
Always discount after-tax CFs at after-tax interest rates
Normally, these calculations will yield the same result if 
the capital gains (CG) tax rate = ordinary income (OI) tax rate = (Greek 
symbol “tau”)
In this case, if r = pre-tax interest rate and rAT= after-tax interest rate,
rAT= (1 -) r
34Example:
Par bond with annual coupons at a rate of 5% and maturity value of $1,000.
If the pre-tax discount rate r = 5%, we know

If the tax rate = 40%, the after-tax discount rate is rAT= (1 -) r = (1 -.40) 5%  = 3%, 
and the after-tax coupon rate is similarly (1 - )5% = 3%.

Here rAT= (1 -)(r) = (1 –40%)(5%) = 3%,

What if OI≠ CG? To value an asset in this situation, the problem is that we don’t 
know the value of rATfrom the outset. To solve the after-tax problem, we 
therefore take the following steps:
Compute the value of the pretax instrument V0at discount rate r and set this 
equal to the after-tax value 
Find the discount rate rATthat makes the present value of the after tax cash 
flows equal to this value. 
The effective tax rate e satisfies rAT=(1-e)r.

2141Variable Interest Rates
Spot Rates
•For t>0, define the t-year spot rate as follows:
rst= effective annualinterest rate earned by money invested now for a period of t years.  
•Spot rates are sometimes called zero coupon rates.
•Spot rates are quoted for U.S. Treasury securities or other default-free zero-coupon securities.
•Treasury bills, which have maturities of 1 year or less, are zero-coupon bonds (ZCBs).
•Treasury notes, which have maturities of more than 1 year but less than 10 years, and Treasury 
bonds, which have maturities of more than 10 years, pay semiannual coupons.
•Hence, if you want spot rates based on U.S. Treasuries for terms of longer than one year, they 
can only be determined by removing (“stripping off”) the coupons. 
•The coupon bond is decomposed into a series of ZCBs with terms increasing by 6 months each.
•The resulting ZCBs are called STRIPS and actual market yields are available.
42Simplified annual example:
A one-year ZCB has price of $950 and matures at $1,000.
A two-year bond has price of $975, pays annual coupons of $50, 
and matures at $1,000.
Calculate the spot rates rs1and rs2.
First approach:  (brute force method):  
First calculate rs1:

42

2/25/2025
2243Second approach:  Decompose (“strip”) the two-year coupon bond with a price of $975 into two ZCBs:
One-year ZCB paying $50
Two-year ZCB paying $1,050
What is the price of the one-year $50 ZCB?
We were given that a one-year ZCB maturing at $1,000 has a price of $950.  
Therefore, the price of a one-year ZCB maturing at $50 must be (50/1,000) = 5% of $950, or $47.50.
What is the price “P” of the $1,050 two-year ZCB?
Two-year coupon bond = (One-year ZCB paying $50) + (Two-year ZCB paying $1,050)
Of course, one can generalize this 
process to bonds with terms of n > 2 
years.  The general recursive process 
of solving for rstgiven rs1, rs2, …, rs(t-1)
is sometimes referred to as 
“bootstrapping.”975 47.50 P  

Term Structure and ZCBs
44•The term structure plots the relationship between the maturity (term) of a 
bond and its yield to maturity
•All bonds plotted are in the same class
•Examples:  U.S. Government, Municipal, Corporate AAA
•Generally upward-sloping
•Downward-sloping (inverted) yield curve believed to be a forecast of 
recession
•In this class, we will focus on U.S. government ZCBs
•ZCB = Zero coupon bond
•Any other fixed rate bond can be constructed and therefore priced from ZCBs
•Easy market references for risk-free ZCBs exist in the U.S. and most 
developed economies
•T-Bill (treasury bill)
•U.S. Government STRIPS
•Simplify present value calculations
•Each discount rate is known for a particular maturity
•Corresponds to cash flow at that maturity
•Easier to compute forward rates

No Arbitrage: f is set to ensure (a) and (b) have the same FV
1.0222= 1.02(1 + f)  f = 2.4004%
© 2020 David C. Shimko. All rights reserved.What is the “Forward Rate”?
An interest rate implicitly “locked in” in the future by buying a bond today.
Can think of it as an “expected,” “estimated,” “implied,” or “best guess” future spot rate
What conditions does the forward rate need to satisfy (discrete case)?
Note that the average of the 1-year spot rate and the forward rate is about 2.2%;
In other words, 2.0% + 2.4004% 2.2%
Using continuous discounting, the forward rate is exactly 2.4%. 
48Discrete formula relating spot rates and forward rate:2
2 1 12(1 ) (1 )(1 )s sr r f   
Under continuous discounting, this becomes2 1 1 12 12 2s s sr r r f fe e e e 
which implies1 11
22s
sr fr
If we now identify1 01sr f
this becomes01 11
22sf fr
Thus the 2-year spot rate is the average of the one-year forward rates 
(this is true exactlyin the continuous discounting case, approximatelyin the discrete case).(because etrplays the role of (1+r)t)
Note:  When the text says “approximatelyin the discrete case,” it’s referring to an 
arithmetic average.  If we instead measure the compound average, the 2-year spot rate 
is exactlyequal to the compound average (sometimes abbreviated CAGR).    That is, 
       2

which implies01 12 23 1, ...n n
snf f f frn    
This shows more generally that the annual n-year spot rate is the (exact or 
approximate) average of the one-year forward rates .  
Note:  The same caveat as before with respect to the two-year average in the discrete 
case applies to the n-year average in the discrete case.  
That is, if in the discrete case we measure the compound n-year average rather than the 
arithmetic n-year average, the n-year spot rate is exactlyequal to the compound average 
of the one-year forward rates. 
50If spot rates are increasing with duration, the forward rates must therefore rise even faster.  
There is a numerical example in the text.
Intuitively, the n-year spot rate equals the average of the successive one-year forward rates. 
But the first one-year forward rate equals the first one-year spot rate, which is less than the n-
year spot rate.  Thus the one-year forward rates are starting at a lower point than the n-year 
spot rate, and hence they must increase faster in order to average to the n-year spot rate.
Mathematically, for the discrete case:

But if the spot rates are increasing with duration,

2651Most generally, the formula for deriving forward rates from spot rates is
where
forward rate for the time interval [t, u ] extending from time t to time utuf
Key Point:  Note that the above forward rate is only the theoretical or implied(from the spot 
rates) forward rate, as opposed to the actual market interest rate that will become available 
at future time t for a term extending from future time t to future time u.
If you believe the actual market interest rate will be different from the theoretical rate, you 
may be able to make a profit (but only if your prediction is correct).

Determinants of Forward Interest Rates
52•Spot interest rates
•Expected future spot rates
•Inflation
•Risk premium –depending on market 
demand and supply of debt
•Expectations hypothesis –Forward rates 
equal expected future spot rates
•Liquidity premium hypothesis –Forward 
rates exceed expected future spot rates 
because
•Issuers want to naturally borrow 
longer term
•Investors naturally want to lend 
shorter term

2753Valuing Risk-Free CFs with Variable Interest Payments
Suppose you need to value a sequence of fixed CFs of $100 at the end of years 1 –10.  
You can discount each cash flow separately at the corresponding spot rate of interest:
 2 3 10
0 1 2 3 10100 ...s s s s PV v v v v    
     2 3 10
1 2 3 101 1 1 1100 ...11 1 1s s s srr r r 
         
54For example, the textbook shows that the fixed CFs of $100 at the end of years 1 –10, 
have a price of $900.78 and corresponding compound average yield (IRR) of 1.95%:
 Date Spot Rate PV(100) CF
0 -900.78
1 1.22% 98.795 100
2 1.40% 97.258 100
3 1.54% 95.519 100
4 1.67% 93.590 100
5 1.78% 91.556 100
6 1.89% 89.374 100
7 1.98% 87.176 100
8 2.07% 84.882 100
9 2.16% 82.503 100
10 2.24% 80.129 100
Total 900.78
IRR 1.95%
But what if the CFs aren’t fixed?  What if the interest rates AND the cash flows are variable?53

28Valuing a floating rate note (FRN)
55•For most FRNs, the interest rate is determined in arrears
•Next quarter’s coupon payment is based on the 3-month interest rate today
•Coupon = Rate x Principal
•What is the value of a 3-month FRN? (F=principal)
•GVE: 𝑟଴𝑉଴=𝐹−𝑉଴+𝑟଴𝐹,𝑜𝑟 𝑉଴=𝐹
•What is the value of a 6-month FRN?
•GVE: 𝑟ଵ𝑉ଵ=𝐹−𝑉ଵ+𝑟ଵ𝐹  𝑜𝑟  𝑉ଵ=𝐹
•Therefore the value of an FRN does not change when interest rates change!
•Note that r1is not known at time 0
•The second GVE is true regardless of the value of r1

56Valuing Single Variable Cash Flows
What if we need to value a single future cash flow that is a function of the future spot 
interest rate but isn’t part of a floating rate bond?  (For example, we might need to value a 
company with earnings that fluctuate with interest rates.)
In this case, we can’t use the GVE to simply cancel out the unknown spot interest rate r1(or 
more generally, the unknown spot interest rate rt).  But we can use the theoretical or 
implied forward rate to estimate the future spot rate.  
For example, if the actual CF at time t equals rtF, we can model this as ft-1,tF using the 
forward rate information embedded in the spot rate yield curve:
 1,
01t t
t
stf FPV
r
55
56

2/25/2025
2957For example, the textbook gives the following example of valuing an FRN with a face 
value of F = $100 and annual coupons of rtF:
FRN Payments - Individual Present Value
F = 100
Forward PV using
Date Spot Rate Equivalent Cash Flow Spot Rates

1 1.22% 1.22% 1.22 1.21
2 1.40% 1.58% 1.58 1.54
3 1.54% 1.83% 1.83 1.75
4 1.67% 2.04% 2.04 1.91
5 1.78% 2.24% 2.24 2.05
6 1.89% 2.41% 2.41 2.15
7 1.98% 2.57% 2.57 2.24
8 2.07% 2.71% 2.71 2.30
9 2.16% 2.84% 2.84 2.34
10 2.24% 2.96% 102.96 82.50
Total 100.0
58One might guess (from the case of fixed level interest rates) that the total value of a par bond would 
be equal to the face value.  But why does it work for variable spot rates and forward rates?
It’s because the one-year forward rates are embedded in the spot rates.  Symbolically:

•Also assume conditional probability of death is = 1% per year, and risk-free rate r = 5% per year.
•What is the value of the policy, ignoring any possible risk premium?

Note that we could also derive this by the brute force (i.e. actuarial) method:  If =

However, this general approach to calculating V0would work even if the conditional

74For the insurance policy that pays $100,000 at time of death, another way to see that:
0 00rV V C   
Is as follows:
Required Return = Expected CG + Expected  CF
0 1 0 1rV E V V E C  
The cash flow is a discrete RV with only  two values,
$0 if the insured doesn't die, and $100, 000 if the insured dies,
so it's easy to calculate the expected value:C

3875For the expected capital gain, we can us e the Law of Total Expectation,
since the events that the insured dies and the insured doesn't die
constitute a partition of the probability space : 

39Another Example:
Auto policy pays C = $15,000 for each year there’s an accident.
= probability of an accident in a year = 10%
= probability of death in a year = 1%
(Note that both and δare conditional on survival to the beginning of the year.)
r = 5%
Use the GVE: Required Return = Expected CG + Expected CF

Note that
1. This can be interpreted as a perpetuity with expected payments C in the 
numerator and a higher discount rate (r + instead of r) in the denominator, 
reflecting the possibility of death and hence termination of the policy
2. Similar to the life insurance example, the same result for V0can also be derived 
by the brute force (i.e., the actuarial) method, but with the PV of the expected 
payment in any year t set equal to vtC(1 -)t-1.  
3. In this expression, (1 - ) is the conditional probability of surviving (i.e., of not 
dying) each year, and is the conditional probability of an accident in each year.
4. V0= sum of PVs of the expected payments vtC(1 -)t-1from t = 1 to ∞ (this is a 
geometric series, similar to the previous life insurance policy).77

4079For the auto policy that pays $15,000 in each year there’s an accident, we can examine 
the probabilities and expected values in more detail, similarly to what we did for the life 
insurance policy.  
This will allow us to verify that the previous expressions for the expected capital gain 
and expected cash flow are correct.
Required Return = Expected CG + Expected  CF
The cash flow is a discrete RV with only  two values, $0 if there isn't an accide nt, 
and $15,000 if there's an accident, so i t's easy to calculate the expected value : C

82Modeling Default
Default occurs with some probability per year, so it is an event risk.
= default rate in a year

1 -= recovery rate = % of value not lost upon default (must be ≥ 0%)
r = risk-free rate81

4283Suppose we have a one-year ZCB with maturity value F.  Use the GVE: 
Required Return = Expected CG + Expected CF
Promised Capital Gain = F –V0, but expected loss = F, so
0 0rV F V F    

The first expression for z is the “exact credit spread,” and the last expression for z is 
the “approximate credit spread (in both cases with no risk premium), which is also 
sometimes referred to as the “expected loss rate.”
86For the one-year ZCB, similar to the ins urance problems we tackled earlier, we c an examine 
the probabilities and expected values in more detail, and we can also make some choices in 
how we model the random CG and CF, because in this pre-tax  problem, there's no issue of 
different tax rates on ordinary income vs. capital gains.

11Valuation for Financial Engineering  --textbook by David C. Shimko
Chapter 4:  Bonds
Once you know the yield to maturity, the coupon accrual conventions, the quoting 
conventions, applicable tax treatment, liquidity, inflation rate, and anything else that 
affects the value of the bond, you can value a bond.
For many bonds, however, the market price is a better indicator of value than a 
theoretical model. 
Hence, bond prices can be used to infer parameters that might be unknown or 
difficult to estimate.
In Chapter 3, we learned how to determine bond forward rates and currency 
forward prices from the observed ZCB term structure.
In Chapter 4, we’ll see how to determine implied real rates of interest, inflation 
rates, tax rates, default rates and estimates of loss upon default for corporate bonds
We’ll start with U.S. government bonds, then move to corporate bonds.
Gov’t Bonds –“Risk Free”
•The most basic  debt instruments are 
developed country debt
•The assumption behind the pricing is 
that these securities are not subject 
to any appreciable default risk
•In reality, implicit default risk 
premiums are apparent when you 
look at the rates of the various 
countries in the EU (all of whom 
issue EUR denominated debt)
•The Government Debt market is huge. 
In 2020, the US Debt is on the order 
of $22 Trillion USDUS Government Debt

2“Federal Debt and the Statutory Limit, February 2023
•The debt limit—commonly called the debt ceiling—is the maximum 
amount of debt that the Department of the Treasury can issue to the public 
or to other federal agencies. 
•The amount is set by law and has been increased or suspended over the 
years to allow for the additional borrowing needed to finance the 
government’s operations. 
•On December 16, 2021, lawmakers raised the debt limit by $2.5 trillion to a 
total of $31.4 trillion. 
•On January 19, 2023, that limit was reached, and the Treasury announced a 
“debt issuance suspension period” during which, under current law, it can 
take well-established “extraordinary measures” to borrow additional funds 
without breaching the debt ceiling.”

35U.S. Government Bonds
In Chapter 4 we’ll discuss the following five types of U.S. government bonds:
Treasury bills are ZCBs with less than a year to maturity. 
Treasury notes andtreasury bonds are fixed-rate bonds:
oTreasury notes are typically issued with 5 years or less to maturity
oTreasury bonds are issued with up to 30-year maturities
FRNs are 2-year floating rate notes with variable interest rates
TIPS are designed to protect against unknown inflation rates
6Basic tax treatment of interest income for U.S. government bonds:
Interest income is taxable at the federal level
Interest income is tax-free at the state and local levels
Principal increases for TIPS are treated like interest income5
6

3/11/2025
47Treasury Bills
As mentioned, 
T-bills are ZCBs with < 1 year to maturity
The maturity value = $10,000
The challenge in using T-bills is a legacy (i.e., “old-fashioned” or “out of date”) quote system.  
8A brief explanation of the interest rate in advance “d” which corresponds to an 
effective annual interest rate r:
  (i.e., d is defined as the PV of inter est r)1rd r vr  
1 1This implies that 1 11 1 1 1r r rd vr r r r         
Hence the PV of $10,000
 10,000 10,000 1v d  
This means that discounting at interest rate “r” is equivalent to paying interest at 
rate “d” in advance, i.e., the borrower can borrow 10,000v or borrow 10,000 and 
pay interest in advance, the result is the same.7

Note that this price formula is based on the assumption of a 360-day year.
Note also that the quoted yield is in the form of a simplediscount rate, i.e., it is in 
the form of simple interest in advance .
(“Simple” means that you “simply” multiply the annual rate by the fraction of the 
year, rather than using a fractional exponent as you would for a compound 
effective rate.)BRL19

18Idealized U.S. Government Coupon Bond
U.S. government notes and bonds have 
semi-annual coupons = 1,000(c/2), where c = annual coupon rate;
face value = $1,000 = maturity value
Simplifying “idealized” assumptions:
1. The valuation date is just after (i.e., immediately after) a coupon is paid 
2. The coupons are evenly spaced at 6 month intervals 
3. The annual yield is based on the “annual percentage rate” (APR) of the semiannual yield 
4. Bonds are priced in decimals 
In reality, 
1. the price between coupon payment dates = quoted price + accrued interest since previous 
coupon date;
2. coupons are about 6 months apart, but the number of days between coupon payments varies by 
a few days; 
3. there are many ways to compute yield, this is just the simplest; and 
4. bonds may be priced in 32nds, not always in decimals.17

General steps for calculating the price or bond value using financial calculator or Excel:
Clear financial memories if applicable
Set the payment equal to 1000c/2
Set the future value (value in addition to the last payment) equal to 1000
Set the discount rate equal to the yield divided by 2 (some calculators use whole 
number yields, and others use decimal)
Set n equal to the number of coupon payments (not the number of years!! )
Press PV key to compute present value
20Example:  6% coupon 10-year bond with a 5% YTM.
Set the payment equal to 1000(.06/2) = 30
Set the future value equal to 1000
Set the discount rate equal to the yield 5% divided by 2 = 2.5%
Set n equal to the number of coupon payments = 2 x 10 = 20

1121Review of terminology:
If the coupon rate > YTM, the bond trades at a premium
If the coupon rate < YTM, the bond trades at a discount
If the coupon rate = YTM, the bond trades at par
22Prices are often quoted in decimals, with yields reported as 2 x the semi-annual yield.
For example, if the coupon, price and yield are quoted as 2.38%, 101.14, and 2.25%, 
respectively, this means that:
the semi-annual coupon = 1,000(.0238/2) = $11.90, 
the price = 1,000(1.0114) = 1,011.40, and 
the semi-annual yield = .0225/2 = .01125 = 1.125%.21

1223STRIPS
STRIPs stands for “Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of 
Securities.”
The U.S. decided in 1985 to “strip” the coupons and principal components of 
bonds and offer them as separate securities.
These securities are priced and traded separately in the STRIPS market.
Price is quoted per $100 of principal.
24The price is equal to the PV of the $100 maturity value at the EAY:

Bootstrapping T-Bills and STRIPs
•Many different ways to estimate a 
full ZCB yield curve.
•In this case, imagine a flexible 
functional form, and use regression 
to fit the curve
Example:  
•Shown (green):  a1=2, else =0
•Objective:  Minimize sum of squared 
deviations between model and 
actual yields.

1427Bootstrapping without STRIPS
STRIPS data was widely reported in the financial press prior to 2019, but has 
become more difficult to obtain. 
Also, financial engineers working in banks will want to use all available bond 
pricing data to get the most accurate ZCB curve possible. 
Fortunately, a slight modification of the method described in the last section 
works well even with coupon bonds.
28Bootstrapping without STRIPS, continued
With coupon-paying bonds, the procedure is as follows:
1. Find the exact coupon dates (t) and payment amounts Ctfor each payment date
2. Use the same function as in the preceding section to model the ZCB discount rate 
function y(t):
 5 2
1 2 3 4 6 7 loga ty t a a t a t a e a t a        
3. The model bond price is the present value of the payment amounts Ctfor each 
payment date using y(t) and continuous compounding:
Model Bond Price y t t
tC e
4. The squared deviation is the square of the difference between the observed 
(i.e., the model) prices and the market (i.e., actual) prices of the coupon 
bonds in the bond pricing data.27
28

3/11/2025
1529Bootstrapping without STRIPS, continued
Key point:  In the preceding sectionwe estimated the ZCB yield curve y(t) directlyusing 
STRIPS ZCB data.  We were able to compute and minimize squared deviations between 
omodel yieldsy(t) and 
oactual market yieldsof STRIPS ZCBs, which we could get directly from quotes.  
In this sectionwe are estimating the ZCB yield curve y(t) indirectlyusing coupon bond 
data, not STRIPS ZCB data.   Hypothetical ZCB yields corresponding to coupon bond 
payments aren’t availablefrom coupon bond data, but market prices of the coupon bonds 
are available.  Hence in this section, we compute squared deviations between 
omodel bond prices(corresponding to the above model yields y(t)) and 
oactual market bond prices, which we can get directly from quotes.
5. Make sure the market prices include accrued interest (dirty prices)
6. Choose the “a” parameters to minimize the sum of squared deviations for all available risk-
free bonds.
This procedure provides a ZCB discount rate curve using continuous compounding, and can 
therefore be used to value any risk-free at cash flows at known times.
Revisiting inflation
•No index is perfect
•CPI (Consumer Price Index) is 
most widely followed and used in 
labor contracts
•Many compensation contracts 
have a cost-of-living adjustment 
clause (COLA)
•To value these contracts, use the 
appropriate real rate of interest
•The TIPS bond has payments 
adjusted for inflation, similar to a 
COLA clause30

16TIPS:  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
Features?
•Principal and interest calculations
•Principal is increased/decreased with changes 
in inflation; interest payments are tied to principal
•Taxation of capital gain
•Increase of principal subject to federal tax, but
exempt from state and local taxes
•Embedded option
•Final Principal payments is at least par 
insulated from deflation
•Implied inflation now?
•Implied inflation ≈ Risk-free rate –rate on TIPS

TIPS:  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
32Simplified Example: 
5 year TIPS bond, 2% coupon, Initial Principal = $1,000
Year 1: 2 payments of $10 (2%*$1,000/2)
CPI increases by 5% => New Principal = $1,050
Year 2: 2 payments of 2%*$1,050/2 = $10.50
CPI flat => Principal Remains same
Year 3: 2 payments of $10.50
CPI decreases by 3% => New Principal = $1,018.50
Year 4: 2 payments of 2%*$1,018.50/2 = $10.19
CPI decreases by 4% => New Principal =$977.76
Year 5: 2 payments of 2%*$997.76/2 = $9.98
Principal of $X returned

1733TIPS and Inflation
TIPS stands for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
First issued by U.S. government in 1997.
Provide protection against inflation, especially for pension funds and long-term 
investors.
Adjusted Principal = Original Principal x (CPIt/CPI0)
Maturity Value = max (Original Principal, Adjusted Principal)   (embedded option)
Semiannual interest = (Fixed Coupon Rate) x Adjusted Principal
Note:  Unlike the maturity value, the interest payments can fall with deflation (no 
guaranteed floor)
34Additional notes:
TIPS aren’t a complete inflation hedge because not only coupons but also increases 
in principal are subject to federal taxation (but neither is subject to state or local 
taxation).
Increases in principal are taxable for the year in which they occur, even if the TIPS 
haven’t matured (so the investor hasn’t actually received a payment of principal).
Deflation adjustments in TIPS decrease the taxpayer’s cost basis.
TIPS can be used to estimate the expected inflation rate.33

1835Review of Fisher Equation:
111r
i 
r = nominal interest rate
= real interest rate  
i= inflation rate
We saw in Chapter 3 that this implies
     or  equivalently,    r i i r    
36Why TIPS yields are like real yields (to a first approximation):
If normal government bonds have a nominal yield of 4%, and TIPS for the same maturity have a yield of 2.5%, the 
market’s equilibrium expectation is that the annualized average CPI rate will be 1.5% (i.e., that the TIPS inflation 
adjustments will provide an additional 1.5% return), Why? 
― The r = 4% market yield on normal government bonds is a nominal yield since it is based on the scheduled 
coupon and principal payments which are nominal CFs because they won’tbe adjusted for inflation.  
― The = 2.5% market yield on TIPs is a real yield since it is based on the scheduled coupon and principal 
payments which are real CFs because they willbe adjusted for inflation.  
― Hence, the annualized average inflation rate iexpected by the market must be i r -= 4% -2.5% = 1.5%.   
If actual inflation rate iexceeds 1.5% annually, the TIPS bondholders will receive a higher real return (of = 2.5%) 
than the nominal bondholders (of = 4% -i< 2.5%). This 1.5% threshold is referred to as the “inflation break-
even point” at which TIPS will have the same value as normal government bonds.
Since we know that the real yield equals the nominal yield minus inflation, this also implies that the 2.5% = 4% -
1.5% yield on the TIPS represents the market’s expectation of the real yield.
Why are TIPS yields like real yields only “to a first approximation”?  
― Because there is (1) an illiquidity premium and (2) an inflation-protection premium, i.e., investors are willing 
to sacrifice some yield in order to receive protection against inflation.  So 2.5% is actually a little  < 4% -i.35

19U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)
U.S. Treasury began issuing in January 2014
Offered to investors at auctions each month
Term = 2 years
Quarterly coupons
Variable interest rates
oDetermined “in arrears” for each individual coupon date
o1stcoupon payment is known at issue of the bond
o2nd–8thcoupon payments unknown until the beginning of each quarter
37
U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) continued
Coupon rate = 13-week T-bill auction rate + FRN spread
oT-bills are auctioned every week
oFRN spread is determined on FRN issue date
oFixed FRN spread doesn’t change over the entire FRN term
oThis means that actual FRN coupons have both floating and fixed components
oActual FRNs aren’t purely floating like the idealized FRNs in Chapter 3
oFRNs should be valued as a combination of a floating rate note and a fixed 
rate note

38

3/11/2025
20Example:
An FRN auction settles with 0.22% fixed component and 0.238% initial floating 
component (“high discount margin”)
0.22% and 0.238% quoted rates are quarterly, not annual
Nearly half of the interest payment is fixed, not floating
39
FRNs are also traded outside the U.S. in the Eurodollar market
In the past, LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate) for U.S. dollars used as a short-
term benchmark rate
LIBOR was originally intended as the rate at which banks could borrow from one 
another in London
Because of fraud scandals in 2012, LIBOR was discontinued for pricing new loans 
In January 2022 and replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
By June 2023, the LIBOR indexes used to set interest rates for many types of 
existing adjustable-rate loans will also have been phased out.

40

3/11/2025
21Key point:  In Chapter 3 we saw that 
FRN values “remain constant at par value (face amount) as interest rates change”
But be careful; if you look back at Chapter 3, you’ll see that’s not exactly correct!
What we actuallyshowed is that FRN values stay the same on each coupon date
The FRN values don’tremain constant betweencoupon dates; how come?
oOn each coupon date, the next coupon rate is determined and no longer floats! 
41
Municipal Bonds (Munis)
Munis are issued by non-federal government entities, such as states, cities and 
counties. 
Literally, a “municipality” is a city, town, county or village with corporate status 
and local government
Munis aren’t guaranteed by the U.S. government, so default is possible 
However, in many cases munis are rated AAA due to:
ounderlying collateral, 
oability of the municipality to collect taxes, or 
oinsurance provided by a third party insurance company.
4241
42

3/11/2025
22Municipal Bonds (Munis), continued
Chapter 4 focuses on AAA munis and implied tax rates (versus default risk)
U.S. government bond coupons taxable at federal level, tax-free at state and local level
Municipal bond coupons tax-free at the federal, state and local levels (within same state)
oHence munis are often called “triple tax free”
These are the general tax rules, but there can be complications: 
oCapital gains from municipal bond sales are taxable at federal and state levels
oMunicipal bond interest can be subject to federal Alternative Minimum Tax (
AMT) for “private activity” bonds
KEY POINT:  In general, if government bonds are held to maturity, 
oMunicipal gov’t bond coupons are tax-free 
oFederal gov’t bond coupons are taxed at federal level
43
Since muni coupons are federally tax-free whereas U.S. Treasury coupons are federally 
taxed, the bonds must be priced so that 
•after-tax Treasury yields are approximately equal to tax-free muni yields 
•i.e., munis don’t have to yield as much as treasuries because muni coupons are tax-free.  
More precisely, taking into account the possibility of muni default and risk premium,
Municipal yield = (1- ) Treasury yield + Expected loss rate + Additional risk premium
= (1-) Treasury yield + + 
where as in Chapter 3,
= (federal) tax rate 
= annual default rate of the bond
= loss rate = % of value lost upon default
= risk premium (as a percentage)
4443
44

3/11/2025
23We can solve this equation for the tax rate:
= (Treasury yield -Municipal yield  + + )/Treasury yield
The text contains the following example, based on Treasury and (Bloomberg) Muni yields 
reported on 5/28/2017, a 5 basis point expected loss rate ( ), and a 0% risk premium ( ):
Treasury Muni Implied Tax Rate
Yields Yieldsfor Assumed Loss Rate of 0.05%
1 1.15% 0.77% 37.39%
2 1.29% 0.91% 33.33%
5 1.79% 1.28% 31.28%
10 2.25% 1.95% 15.56%
20 2.91% 2.02% 32.30%
This shows that the tax rate embedded in the differential between the Treasury 
yields/prices and the Muni yields/prices was approximately 33%, which was in fact equal to 
the highest marginal federal tax rate as of 5/28/2017.
45
Corporate Bonds
Recall from Chapter 3 that for a corporate (i.e., defaultable) bond, 
Yield to Maturity (YTM) ≈ risk-free rate + expected loss + risk premium
= r + + 
where 
r = risk-free rate on a U.S. gov’t. bond with similar maturity
= annual default rate of the bond
= loss rate = % of value lost upon default (aka Loss Given Default or LGD)
= risk premium (as a percentage)

24Credit –Loss Given Default
47Determining Loss Given Default (“λ”) is a very important consideration and a large area of research 
as well. 
The table on the right shows prices at default 
for bonds at various levels of seniority. 
“Seniority” is the relative ranking in the capital 
structure –e.g., how much preference the 
bonds would get when it comes to handing out 
money under default. 
This can be taken as being the effective 
recovery rate, or 1-λ. You can see that there is a 
lot of variation in the numbers, as measured by 
standard deviation.
LGD will also vary by other factors –most 
notably industry and state of the economy.

Moody’s and S&P are the leading 
bond rating agencies for corporate 
debt (though there are other 
significant players, like Fitch)
They both put out regular studies of 
realized default rates by rating class
These ratings can be very important –
institutional investors/creditors are 
often restricted to investing in obligors 
meeting a minimum rating standard
In particular, bonds are typically 
segregated into “Investment Grade” 
(Moody’s Baa & up/ S&P BBB and up) 
or “High Yield” (rest). High Yield is 
sometimes referred to as “Junk”! © 2020 David C. Shimko. All rights reserved.

Example:
Text has data for 
an AA-rated 26-year GE bond yielding 4.04% (as shown in preceding slide)
a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yielding 2.84%
S&P AA 1-year default rate of 0.02% (as shown in preceding slide)
oNote: 1-month default rate is computed as 1 –(1 -.0002)^(1/12) = 0.0017%
Decomposition of yield:  
•GE YTM = 4.04%
•Risk-free rate (30 years) = 2.84% 
•Total credit spread = 4.04% -2.84% = 1.20%
•Probability of default = 0.02% (S&P AA 1-year)
•LGD = 100% (assumed)
•Expected loss = 0.0002 x 1.00 = 0.02%
•Additional risk premium = 1.20% -0.02% = 1.18%
•Another example is as follows:5251

•Risk-free rate (1.5 years) = 1.39% 
•Total credit spread = 2.42% -1.39% = 1.03%
•Probability of default = 0.22% (Moody’s Baa 1 year)
•LGD = 60% (assumed)
•Expected loss = 0.0022 x 0.60 = 0.13%
•Additional risk premium = 1.03% -0.13% = 0.90%53

Valuing a Defaultable Bond –Exact Formula
Key points:
LGD is measured relative to book value, not market value; why? 
oThere may not be any reported market value with loans/private placements.
Book value = PV of scheduled bond payments at scheduled contractual rate
Value of defaultable bond = PV of default-adjusted CFs at risk-free rate
Estimated PDs correspond to letter ratings 
LGDs determined based on country, industry, seniority, loan security, other factors.
Moody’s overall average LGD for all U.S. loans in database = 60%.

28Example:
Bond has scheduled annual coupons of $55 
Scheduled principal repayment is $1000 in 5 years. 
Simple annual risk-free rate r = 4%, 
Annual probability of default (PD) =3%
Loss given default (LGD) = 60%. 
What is the expected value of the bond? 
The text lists four steps to the exact formula valuation process: 
1. Compute the probability distribution associated with the default dates 
2. For each default date, determine the cash flows conditional on default 
3. For each default date, find the PV of default-adjusted cash flows at the risk-free rate 
4. Value the cash flows by computing the expected value over all the possible default dates 
55
56In the absence of default, the present value could be calculated at 4% interest simply as:

However, we are told that there is a non-zero annual probability of default (PD) of =3%.55

3/11/2025
2957Step 1:  Compute the probability distribution associated with the default dates
= probability of default in each year
Thus 1 -= probability of non-default (survival) in each year.
Note this is similar to the life insurance example from Chapter 3 where was 
the probability of death!
Let X = year of default.  Note that X is a random variable with probability 
function f(i) such that
f(1) = P(X = 1) = 
f(2) = P(X = 2) = (1 - )
f(3) = P(X = 3) = (1 - )2
etc., etc.
f(i) = P(X = i) = (1 - )i-1 this is called the geometric distribution
58We can verify that f(i) is a valid probability function that sums to one:

Let’s try looking at this process using a formulaic approach.
We know that the probability distribution associated with the default dates is the 
geometric distribution with = 3%
We know the cash flows conditional on default
We want to use this info to calculate the expected present value of the cash flows:
 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5E vCF v CF v CF v CF v CF   
Note that the present value of the 5 cash flows in the parentheses is a random variable!
It is clearly a function of X = year of default.  
We can therefore call it PV(X) and find its expected value based on the distribution of X:

An Analytic Solution for the Defaultable Bond Value
The second approach of computing the PV of the expected cash flows calculated the 
expected cash flows as
( ) (1 ) ( )iE CF CF P X i CF P X i        
where CF was either 55 for i= 1 –4 or 1,055 for i= 5.  Both components of this 
calculation are conditional on when the default occurs.
The second table in the textbook (and previous slide) is based on noticing that 
this expected value can be rearranged and rewritten as
 (1 ) ( ) (1 ) ( )
          (1 ) ( ) ( ) (1 ) ( )
           = (1 ) ( )

37Note that (1 - )CF is the portion of the cash flow that would be recovered in the event of a 
default; therefore it is guaranteed, risk-free, and non-defaultable!  There is no dependenceon 
= probability of default.
On the other hand, CF is the portion of the cash flow that would not be recovered (i.e., 
would be forfeited) in the event of a default; therefore it is nonguaranteed, risky, and 
defaultable!  In another words, this portion will only be received if the bond does notdefault.
Decomposing the cash flows this way allows us to rewrite the PV of expected cash flows as:

Note that the first guaranteed, non-defaultablepiece is in the form of a level 
annuity(plus a repayment of principal at maturity).
It can be evaluated (in Excel, on a financial calculator, or via level annuity formula 
with final maturity repayment) as

The second nonguaranteed, defaultablepiece is in the form of a “growing” annuity 
where the “growth” rate is negative 3% (i.e., (1 + g) = (1 - ) = (1 –3%).

3977Risk Adjusted Return for Coupon Bonds
In Chapter 3 when considering valuation of defaultable ZCBs, 
we saw that it was necessary to change t he Chapter 2 formula 
for the price of riskless U.S. governmen t 1-year T-bills or STRIPs
from 
 0     1FVr to      0  1FVr   
where =% risk premium.  
78We summarized this by saying that
  whereas the maturity value of a  ZCB c an be discounted
    at the risk free rate  to reflect the time value of money, r riskless
   the maturity value of a  ZCB needs to  be discounted at 
    a risk adjusted rate   to reflect the expected loss   
    as well as the investor's required risk premium, if any.r  

   It's not difficult to see that a simi lar adjustment to the discount rate
     is appropriate for defaultable coup on bonds.  (One might suspect this
     intuitively since a coupon bond can be "strip
ped" into ZCBs.)77

11Valuation for Financial Engineering  --textbook by David C. Shimko
Chapter 5:  Simulation
Methods of Valuing Assets (and Liabilities):
1. Closed-form solutions (as studied in Chapters 1-4)
2. Binomial and trinomial trees
3. Numerical integration
4. Numerical solution of partial differential equations
5. Simulation
Valuation methods 1-4 restrict model complexity.
Simulation is the slowest and least accurate, but also the most flexible if many random 
variables, e.g.:
Interest rates
Exchange rates
Commodity prices
Event risks
2What is the simulation process, in a nutshell?  
Generate a large # of random outcomes of your model;
Calculate the average outcome (i.e., the sample mean);
Find some statistical measure of reliability of the result.
Contrast this with Chapters 1-4, in which we
Valued deterministic models via the GVE or brute force;
Valued simplifiedstochastic models by calculating:
oExpected Present Values (EPVs) of CFs , or equivalently
oPresent Values of Expected (PVEs) CFs
using closed-form (i.e., “analytic”) methods
(“deterministic” means non-random; “stochastic” means random)1

following a prescribed probability distribution
For many applications, we will need uniform and/or normally 
distributed random numbers3

i.e.,U[a, b]= U[0,1].

47Observations:  
Let Z ~N(0,1) be a standard normal random variable with CDF N(z) = P(Z ≤ z).  
Since probabilities are always numbers between 0 and 1, the range of N(z) =[0, 1].
The random variable Z can take any value z ε[-∞, ∞], i.e, any real number
Hence N(z) maps the real line [-∞, ∞] [0, 1]
Let U ~U[0, 1] be a uniformly distributed random variable over [0, 1]
Hence U can take any value u ε[0, 1]
Suppose N(z) = u where u is a value of U in [0, 1]
Let N-1be the inverse function of the CDF N(z).
Then z = N-1(u), i.e., the inverse of the CDF of Z maps the value of U to the value of Z.
This suggests that Z is equivalent to the random variable defined by N-1(U).
8This works with any distribution, not just the normal distribution.
oSuppose X is any random variablewith CDF F(x), and U ~U[0, 1]
oP(F-1(U) ≤x) = P(U ≤F(x))     (since any CDF F(x) must be an increasing function)
oP(U ≤F(x)) = F(x)                    (since the CDF of U is U(x) = x on [0, 1])
oThis F-1(U) has CDF F(x)
oThis F-1(U) and X are equivalent         (since they have the same distribution)
So, to generate random numbers from any distribution 
oFirst generate U[0, 1] pseudorandom numbers:   u
oThen calculate the inverse CDF of those numbers:   F-1(u)7
8

4/8/2025
59In Excel, uniformly distributed random numbers can be generated with u = RAND()
In somecases, a formula for the inverse CDF F-1(u) of the desired distribution can be derived
The single line F-1(RAND()) will then generate a random number from the desired distribution.
In othercases a formula for the inverse CDF F-1(u) can’tbe derived, e.g., the normal distribution 
However, for the normal distribution, this can easily be addressed in Excel or Python
In Excel the inverse standard normal CDF is given by N-1(u) = NORMSINV(u)
The single line = NORMSINV(RAND()) will generate a standard normal distributed random number 
When the formula is copied, each cell provides a new random number 
A similar function is available in Python: numpy.random.normal(mean, stdev, size).
10Example in which a formula for the inverse CDF can be derived:

12THE SIMULATION CORE LOGIC
Suppose we want to simulate a large number of values of z of a random 
variable Z
oFor example, you can think of the random variable Z as being the 
time until default of a defaultable bond from Chapter 4
We want to know the expected value of f(Z), a function of the random 
variable Z 
oFor example, you can think of the function f(Z) as being the present 
value of the cash flows as a function of the time until default; then 
f(Z) = PV(Z), and we want to know E[PV(Z)].  
oIn chapter 4, we were able to find an analytic closed form solution in 
the simple case
We also want to define our maximum likely error based on a 2 standard 
deviation range (though we might like to use 3 or more standard 
deviations for critical applications)11

Every simulation does it like this
•Generate a large number N of random numbers or vectors z
•Compute outcome values f(z)
•Compute the average value 𝑋തof the f(z) results ---this is your estimate of E[f(z)]
•Compute the standard deviation of the values of f(z).  Let’s call this “s”
•Compute the standard error , which is the standard deviation divided by 𝑁, i.e. 
𝑠/𝑁
•Compute the maximum likely error, which is m times the standard error  = 
𝑚𝑠/𝑁(m is a matter of choice corresponding to the number of standard 
errors)
•If the maximum likely error is too large, increase the size of N in proportion to 
the square of the desired increase in precision.
•The solution is then given by 𝐸𝑓𝑧=𝑋ത±𝑚𝑠/𝑁

1223Begin the simulation by generating 1000 values of z in Excel, by copying the 
formula “ =normsinv(rand()) ” into 1000 cells in a column. 
Then for each cell, compute the value of max(z,c) with the given value of c = 
0.50. 
Finally, compute the mean, standard deviation, standard error and maximum 
likely error. 
Here is an illustration from the text of how your spreadsheet might look (only 
showing the first 10 simulations):

1325Our estimate of the value of E[f(Z)] = E[max(Z,0.5)] from the simulation is 0.6974 +/-
0.0250. 
The true theoretical value of µ = 0.69779 falls within that range. 
If we needed to reduce the size of the maximum likely error (.0250) by a factor of 30, 
we could multiply the number of simulations by 302=  900 for a total of 1,000 x 900 = 
900,000 simulations. 
Note that the randomized z values using 1,000 simulations have a mean of 0.03 and a 
standard deviation of 0.98, not the true theoretical values of 0 and 1. 
Of course, if we are simulating any set of random numbers, we will get values of the 
mean and standard deviations changing with every simulation, i.e. every recalculation 
of the spreadsheet. 
We can use variance reduction techniques to improve on the simulated values of z to 
get more accurate simulation results.
26Variance Reduction Techniques
We saw that an increase in sample size N will increase precision (i.e., decrease 
the width of the confidence interval around the population mean µ).
Another approach is to reduce the sample variance of X = f(Z):
 22

/s N since this will reduce the standard error 
and hence also reduce the width of the confidence interval 
around the population mean µ which you are trying to estimate:

1427Moment Matching
One simple and effective way to reduce sampling variance is to force the first two 
moments, i.e. the mean and standard deviation of the random sample of z values 
to be equal to their theoretical values, i.e. 0 and 1. 
This can be accomplished by replacing each simulated value of z with its 
standardized equivalent, that is, 
z zzs
where we subtract the sample mean from each value of z, and divide 
by the sample standard deviation. 
This technique, called moment matching , eliminates two sources of 
uncertainty from the random sample and can have a positive impact on 
simulation performance.
28We know that the sample mean of N values “xi” of any random variable X is defined as :
1  N

1631Antithetic Sampling
Each time we choose a uniformly distributed random number uifor i= 1, … M, we 
include the value of (1 –ui) for i= 1, … M as a separate random number, for a total of 
N = 2M random numbers. 
For the normal distribution, this has the effect of forcing the mean of the N = 2M 
sample random numbers {zi= F-1 (ui),  -zi=  F-1 (1 –ui), i= 1, … M} to be zero
But this does not affect the variance, since ziand –ziare included in every simulation. 
However, this does create negative correlations between observations in the dataset, 
allowing for some variance reduction. 
Antithetic sampling used to be considered beneficial because the computation time 
for generating an antithetic number (1-ui) was less than the time of creating a new 
pseudorandom number. 
This benefit is not as highly valued now due to advances in computing speed and 
parallel processing.
P.S.  The adjective “antithetic” (= “antithetical”) refers to things that contradict, 
oppose, clash, or cancel each other out.  “Anthesis” is the related noun.
32Unpacking these statements further:
We know that if Z has CDF F(z) and U ~U[0, 1]
oP(F-1(U) z) = P(U F(z)) = F(z)
oHence the CDF of F-1(U) is F(z), which F-1(U) ~ Z
But if U ~U[0, 1] and x ε (0, 1),
oP(1 –U x) = P(U 1 –x) = 1 –P(U 1 –x) = 1 –(1 –x) = x
oThis implies the CDF of 1 –U is G(x) = x, which 1 –U ~U[0, 1]
Hence if Z has CDF F(z) and U ~U[0, 1],
oNot onlyis it true that F-1(U) ~ Z; 
obut it is alsotrue that F-1(1 –U) ~ Z
othis is the basis for antithetic sampling31
32

4/8/2025
1733Suppose zi= F-1(ui) and wi= F-1(1 –ui)
Then F(zi) = uiand F(wi) = 1 –ui
F(zi) = P(Z zi) = 1 –P(Z zi)
If the pdf of Z is symmetric around z = 0 (as it is for Z ~ N(0,1))
oP(Z zi) = P(Z–zi) = F(–zi)
Hence F(zi) = 1 –F(–zi), which F(–zi) = 1 –F(zi) = 1 -ui
But F(wi) = 1 –ui, so if F is strictly increasing (as it is for Z ~ N(0,1)),wi= –zi
Hence it is true that ziand –ziare included in every simulation
This is the theory.  But in practice, once you calculate the zi= F-1(ui) values, 
you can simply negate them directly.
In other words, you do not need to calculate –zi= F-1(1 –ui) from scratch; 
that is, you do not need to calculate them indirectly from the 1 –uivalues

standard normal distribution, how do we see that the sample mean is zero, but 
the sample variance is unaffected?

1937Example
Recall the setup for our previous simulation of 1000 values:
oWe generated 1000 values of z from N(0,1) in Excel, by copying the formula 
“=normsinv(rand()) ” into 1000 cells in a column. 
oThen for each cell, we computed the value of f(z) = max(z,0.50). 
oFinally, we computed the sample mean (as our estimate of E[f(Z)] = E[max(Z,0.5]), 
sample standard deviation, and standard error of the f(z) values. 
To test the impact of moment matching and antithetic sampling, we will now perform 
1000 iterations of our simulation of 1000 values, for a total of 1,000,000 values. 
To judge the efficiency of the variance reduction, we will compute the sample standard 
deviation of the results of every 1000 sims and then compile the results in a two stage 
process.
In Excel, therefore, we will use our original setup to simulate 1000 outcomes, and then 
use a what-if table to generate 1000 results of the 1000 individual simulations. The 
results are summarized in the table below.
38

4/8/2025
2039The first three columns contain the raw z-values, the z values with 
corrected mean (0) and standard deviation (1), and the antithetic 
values; entries 501-1000 are the negative values of 1-500  (we are 
only showing the first 10 simulations). 
The next 3 columns show the values of f(z) for the three methods. 
The final table on the right tabulates 1000 simulations of the results 
of the single simulation done in the spreadsheet (we are only 
showing the first 10 of the 1000 simulations of the rsultsof the 
single simulation). 
For each column, the statistics are computed on the top. 
40Using the basic technique, or the z column, the standard deviations of the 
1000-sim values was 0.0127, which as expected, were lower by a factor of 
about sqrt(1000) from the original f(z) simulation result of 0.3956. 
Remarkably, the moment matching technique reduced the standard error 
by a factor of more than 3.5 times, from 0.0004 to 0.0001. 
The antithetic technique did not have much success with this particular 
problem, though in other problems it may be much more successful. 
In all cases, the large number of final simulations leads to good results for 
all three techniques. 
Perhaps needless to say, different variance reduction techniques work 
better with different simulations, but the results can be significant.39

2141Simulation and the Defaultable Bond Value
Recall the simulation core logic:
Suppose we want to simulate a large number of values of x of a random variable X
oFor example, you can think of the random variable X as being the time until 
default of a defaultable bond from Chapter 4
We want to know the expected value of f(X), a function of the random variable X 
oFor example, you can think of the function f(X) as being the present value of 
the cash flows as a function of the time until default; then f(X) = PV(X), and we 
want to know E[PV(X)].  
oIn chapter 4, we were able to find an analytic closed form solution in the 
simple case
We also want to define our maximum likely error based on a 2 or 3 standard 
deviation range 
In this section we carry out this process for the defaultable bond example from 
Chapter 4.
42Let X = year of default and let =3% be the annual probability of default (PD).  
We saw in Chapter 4 that X is a random variable with geometric probability 
function f(i) such that
f(1) = P(X = 1) = 
f(2) = P(X = 2) = (1 - )
f(3) = P(X = 3) = (1 - )2
etc., etc.
f(i) = P(X = i) = (1 - )i-1
We also noted that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) corresponding to f(i) 
is given by
() ( )F i P X i 
1 ( ) 1 (1 )iP X i       41
42

2243We calculated the “probability weighted average of the default-contingent valuations.”  
The default-contingent valuations are the PV(i) values, and they are averaged together 
using the weights f(i) = P(X=i) from the geometric distribution:

2345To simulate the bond’s value, we take the following steps, adapted for this problem:
1. Determine the bond’s value conditional on defaulting at time ifor each i.
2. Simulate default dates, and assign a bond value to each simulation using step 1.
3. Calculate the average of the values as an estimate of the bond value
4. Calculate the maximum error of the simulation
46Step 1:  By the preceding, we have already done the first step in Chapter 4:
45
46

4/8/2025
2447Step 2:  To simulate the default dates, we use our usual method of first 
generating U[0,1] pseudorandom numbers u, then calculating the inverse CDF 
of those numbers, F-1(u).
In this case (unlike with the normal distribution), we have an explicit, simple 
formula for the CDF and can derive an explicit, simple formula for the inverse 
CDF:

2549However, since default times are integers, we want to generate discrete random 
times, so we have to round up. In Excel, we can use the INT function or the 
ROUNDUP function as follows:

50Similar to the case of the normal distribution, where we saw that the CDF 
mapped the real line the real line [-∞, ∞] [0, 1], in the case of the geometric 
distribution, the CDF F maps the integer default times in [0, ∞] [0, 1], which 
can be seen from the graph in Chapter 5:
49
50

4/8/2025
2651Step 3:  Generate 10,000 possible default dates in Excel from the geometric 
distribution with parameter =3% using this explicit formula for the inverse 
CDF composed with the Excel built-in function RAND():

2753Step 4:  In addition, as we saw in the above summary of our work from Chapter 4, the 
theoretical (“population”) mean µ of the random defaultable bond value could be 
calculated as:

54We can use a similar approach to calculate the theoretical (“population”) 
standard deviation σ of the random defaultable bond value.  First calculate the 
second moment:

3059Multivariate Simulations
Until now we have only been simulating one random variable at a time.
In practice we need to simulate many random variables simultaneously. 
If the random variables were independent, we could simulate them separately.
But in most situations the random variables aren’t independent. 
oFor example, think of the bonds in a bond portfolio
We usually expect random variables to have specified correlations. 
Pearson correlation is the measure of the strength of a linear relationship applied to 
jointly normally distributed random variables.  
oIt makes sense to start with this. 
First, let’s simulate two N(0,1) random variables Z1and Z2with a given correlation . 
oBut how can we do this?
60Try starting with two independent N(0,1) random variables Z1and Z3(which we can 
simulate separately). 
We can keep Z1and then compute Z2as a linear combination of Z1and Z3.
In other words, set Z2= aZ1+ bZ3and try to solve for coefficients a and b such that:
oThe mean of Z2must be 0
oThe variance of Z2must be 1 
oThe correlation between Z1and Z2must be 
The first condition is automatically true:
oE[Z2] = E[aZ1+ bZ3} = aE[Z1] + bE[Z3] = 0 + 0 = 0
oUnfortunately this gives us noinformation about a and b!59
60

4/8/2025
3161The second condition implies: 
oVar(Z2) = Var(aZ1+ bZ3) = a2Var(Z1) + b2Var(Z3) = a2+ b2= 1
oHere we are using that Z1and Z3are independent N(0,1)

Z2has the right mean, variance, and correlation with Z1, but how do we

One way to see this is to look at the moment generating function.

Note:  the above factorization (which yo u can verify is correct algebraically)
is achieved by "completing the square"; because this elementary process is 
very useful, we will make a digression to revie w it, and then circle back to 
show how the above factorization can be easily derived.

3467More importantly for our purposes, we'll  see that this technique of 
"completing the square" can be used
    to evaluate Gaussian integrals for w hich the integrand has a linear 
      term in the exponent,
    and in particular to find Laplace tr ansforms (aka Moment Generating 
      Functions) of density functions (as we seek to do now)
    as well as to find moments of the lo gnormal distribution which we'll 
      encounter in later chapters.

we've thereby confirmed that the linear combination of independent normal

This implies that the correlation matrix is the same as the covariance matrix.
When nonstandardmeans and variances are required, the covariancematrix can 
be used in place of the correlationmatrix to account for the different variance 
levels of the random variables.  The means are then simply added to the result 
(since as we know or can easily verify, adding any constant µ to a random variable 
has no effect on variances or covariances)

80When simulating more than two correlated normal random numbers, the 
Cholesky decomposition is invaluable. 
In this case, let’s suppose we have k random variables with correlation 
matrix A, and we want to simulate N sets of random variables. 
We first produce an Nxkmatrix of uncorrelated random z values. 
We then post-multiply the data by the transpose of the Cholesky 
decomposition of A. The resulting matrix of random numbers has the 
desired correlation matrix.
The appendix of Chapter 5 covers the construction of a Cholesky 
decomposition, moment matching to “purify” the sample data, and the 
Cholesky transformation to create data with the specified covariance matrix.
In the following slides, we’ll walk through these ideas in more detail.79

4181Computing the Cholesky Decomposition of a Covariance Matrix
•In Chapter 5, we derived a 2 x 2 upper triangular matrix such that we could post-multiply 
two independent (hence uncorrelated) N(0,1) random variables Z1and Z3by it to produce 
two correlated N(0,1) random variables Z1and Z2with a given correlationmatrix.    
•We verified that if we pre-multiplied this upper triangular matrix by its lower triangular 
transpose, we reproduced the 2 x 2 correlation matrix of  Z1and Z2.  We called the lower 
triangular matrix the “lower triangular Cholesky decomposition” of the correlation matrix.
•We then showed that in the context of nonstandardnormal random variables, there was a 
similar 2 x 2 upper triangular matrix  such that we could post-multiply two independent 
(hence uncorrelated) N(0,1) random variables Z1and Z3by it and add the means to 
produce two correlated nonstandardnormal random variables X1and X2with the given 
means and given covariancematrix.   
•We also verified that if we pre-multiplied this upper triangular matrix by its lower 
triangular transpose, we reproduced the 2 x 2 covariancematrix of X1and X2.  
82We now consider how to determine the lower triangular Cholesky decomposition 
of any given covariance matrix A.  Denoting this lower triangular matrix by R, and 
its upper triangular transpose by RT, we seek to find R such that RRT= A.  
Let’s first consider the 2 x 2 case.  Since R is lower triangular, the equation RRT= A 
implies that:

We then use these equations for the elements of R and A to solve for the elements of 
R, one column at a time, moving from top to bottom and from left to right.  
It may help to thinkof replacing the first column of A with the first column of R, then 
the second column of A with the second column of R, and so on.81

4283Replace the first column of A with the first column of R:

120    (because we want R to be lower tria ngular) r
2 2 2
21 22 22 22 22 21r r a r a r    
84We can check that the above solutions for the elements of R are actually correct by 
applying them directly to the general covariance matrix:

dimension of 2 x 2, 3 x 3, or higher can be obtained.
Next, let’s investigate whether there’s any way to use such a decomposition to 
generalize our process for simulating 2 correlated nonstandard normal random 
variables to k > 2 correlated nonstandard normal random variables.
Suppose we want to simulate k > 2 correlated nonstandard normal random variables.

4997Additional Notes on Cholesky Decomposition
We now know 
how a Cholesky decomposition of a covariance matrix A of any 
dimension can be computed, and
how to use the decomposition to simulate any number of 
correlated normal random variables
how to specialize this to simulation of standardnormal random 
variables using the Cholesky decomposition of their correlation
matrix.
98However, we need to be a little more careful.  
The procedure we developed for finding the Cholesky decomposition of a 
covariance matrix A provides an algorithm for solving for the entries rijof the 
matrix R in terms of the entries aijof the covariance matrix A  such that RRT= A. 
But so far we have always tacitly assumed that the equations for the entries rij
in terms of aijhad a real(as opposed to non-real or complex) solution.  
It turns out that the decomposition algorithm equations will have real solutions 
if (and only if) the matrix A is positive definite .  
We won’t provide a proof in this course, but proofs are readily available, and 
can be based on induction from the 2 x 2 case that we earlier solved 
completely from first principles.97

51101The truecovariance matrix A of the k random variables will always be positive definite, 
and hence the Cholesky decomposition algorithm will produce the desired factorization.
However, in practice, the truecovariance matrix A of the k random variables may not be 
known, and will instead be estimated based on sample data.  
Depending on how the sample data has been compiled, the estimated covariance 
matrix A may not be positive definite, and the Cholesky decomposition algorithm and 
attempt at simulation may fail.  
More information on these issues is of course available in the literature.
102Copulaeand the Correlation of Non-Normal Random Variables 
We saw how to convert simulated normal independent random numbers into correlated 
random numbers. 
However, this approach only works with normally distributed random variables, so how 
can we deal with non-normal random variables?
Suppose we have two bonds. 
oBond A       default rate = A= .05     default date = XA(geometrically distributed r.v.)
oBond B       default rate = B= .10    default date = XB(geometrically distributed.r.v.)
We would like to introduce systemic risk to the analysis of our bond portfolio, so we will 
assume an 80% correlation in the default dates. 
o(XA,XB) = .80  (Note:  For 3 or more bonds, assume a specified correlation matrix.)
We can generate random numbers as values of normally distributed random variables Z1
and Z2with a correlation of 80% using the Cholesky method 
o( Z1, Z2) = .80101
102

4/8/2025
52103To convert these to geometrically distributed default dates, we may first convert them to uniform 
numbers by computing the normal CDF, and then convert them to geometric distributions using the 
inverse CDF of the geometric distribution. 
oWe know the normal CDF N(t) = P(Z t) maps (-∞, ∞) to (0, 1)
oObserve that P(N(Z) t) = P(Z N-1(t)) = N(N-1(t)) = t  
oThis implies that the random variable N(Z) ~U[0,1] is uniformly distributed over [0, 1]
oThus we’ve converted random numbers z1and z2into uniform numbers u1= N(z1) and u2= N(z2)
oThen let H-1(u1) = log(1 –u1)/log(1 -.05) and G-1(u2) = log(1 –u2)/log(1 -.10) be inverse CDFs of the 
geometric distributions with parameters A= .05 and B= .10    
oBut don’t forget to round to integer values as we did previously for the single bond default dates:
 log(1 ) log(1 )1      or alternatively     ,0log(1 ) log(1 )u ui INT i ROUNDUP              
oThen H-1(u1) = H-1(N(z1)) and G-1(u2) = G-1(N(z2)) are geometrically distributed random numbers
oThis is an example of a Gaussian copula, the calculations for which are shown in the text:
104
103

4/8/2025
53105The first two columns are random z values with a correlation of 0.80. 
The second two columns are the CDFs or uniform equivalents N(z) of those values. 
The third set of two columns are the transformed default date simulations using the 
inverse functions H-1and G-1of the geometric CDF.
The graphs illustrate the impact of correlation in defaults on the timing of joint default. 
As expected, when defaults are positively correlated, we see many more outcomes 
where both defaults occur within 10 years of the starting date, as compared to the 
simulations with the negative correlation. 
The copula can be used to capture the essence of correlation while remaining true to 
the geometric distribution model of bond default dates.
You can verify that

106Simulation and Optimization 
We want to optimize some function of one (or more) random variables. 
The text considers a simplified inventory management problem. 
Let “s” = # units of a product purchased and stocked in inventory
Let “D” = # units demanded by customers; 
Assume D is a geometric random variable with P(D = d) = (1 - )d-1with = .10
Expected demand is therefore E[D] = 1/ = 1/.10 = 10 units. 
# units sold = min (s, D). 
Assume gross profit for each unit sold = $5. 
Assume overstocking leads to return or storage costs of $3 per unit
Overstocked quantity = max (s -D, 0) cost of overstocking = $3 x max (s-D, 0) 
Assume understocking leads to disappointed customers costing $7 per unit
Understocked quantity = max (D -s,0) cost of understocking = $7 x max (D –s, 0)
Therefore, ) net profit( , ) 5min( , ) 3max( ,0) 7max( ,0 s D s D s D D s    105
106

4/8/2025
54107We want to stock the correct # units s to maximize E [net profit (s, D). 
One might guess s = E (D) = 10, but since the cost of overstocking is lower than the cost 
of understocking, it would be better to err on the side of having s > 10. But how much 
greater? 
With the geometric distribution, the probability of higher demand levels is decreasing. 
In addition, the choice variable s is integer-valued, so calculus won’t help. 
Therefore, we use simulation to estimate E[net profit(s, D)] for each value of s, and then 
choose the value of s that maximizes E[net profit(s, D)]. 
Letting F(d) = P(D d) = 1 –(1 - )d, simulate random numbers d = #units demanded via:

sample mean as our estimate of E[net profit(s, D)].

might appear like the choppy curve in the diagram below from the text: 107
108

4/8/2025
55109Fortunately, another variance reduction method can be employed. 
If we fix the random numbers for our experiment, and then calculate expected 
profit for each given level of s, we obtain the smooth line is the chart, which is 
easily seen to be optimized at s = 12. 
This is known as the method of common random numbers: In comparisons when 
an inference will be drawn about the change in the simulation result, use the 
same set of random numbers for each simulation.
One weakness of this approach:  It uses fewer random numbers than the fully 
random method
Therefore, any analysis you do of this type should be checked with multiple sets 
of fixed random numbers, each of which will provide a specific optimal solution. 
For example, if we had a “bad” set of random numbers in our optimization 
above, we may have arrived at the incorrect optimal value, having biased all the 
profitability estimates in the same way.
Conclusions
•Any random variable can be simulated by the function F-1(u), where F-1is the inverse CDF of u, 
and u is a uniformly distributed random variable
•To simulate the value of a function of number of uncorrelated random variables (any 
distributions), follow these steps
•Generate N values and calculate the mean
•Calculate the standard deviation, and divide by 𝑁to get the standard error
•Report the mean as your estimate and your “maximum error” as 2 times the standard 
error
•Increase the sample size if more precision is needed
•To correlate normally distributed random variables, use independent random simulations and 
multiply the data vector by the transpose of the Choleskydecomposition of the desired 
covariance matrix
•Correlation is only defined for normal random variables
•To correlate random variables of any distribution, convert correlated normal random numbers 
to uniform distributions, and then use F-1(u) to produce the desired random variables

11Valuation for Financial Engineering  --textbook by David C. Shimko
Chapter 6: Stochastic Processes in Finance
Chapter 5 –simulation of one or more RVs at a point in time
Chapter 6 –simulation of stochastic processes , such as:
Future financial asset prices
Future interest rates
Future commodity prices
Future cash flows
In this chapter we’ll also learn how to:
Use historical data to estimate the parameters of these stochastic processes
Calibrate these processes to assumed future probability distributions
The Random Walk
Random walks were used by French mathematician Louis Bachelierto describe stock 
price movements on the Paris Bourse (i.e., the Paris stock exchange).
Random walks are one of the simplest of all stochastic processes
Efficient Market Hypothesis:
We may not believe that price changes are random.
However, we generally have the same or lessinformation than the market does
Therefore, we can’t expect to forecast prices better than the market 
Price changes might as well be modeled as random, even if they’re not.
But our goals go beyond price forecasting:
To capture potential volatility of future prices
To capture potential correlations between future prices

10Financial Applications of the ARW
Bachelierused the ARW model for stock price fluctuations in the short term.
Problem:           may become negative o ver longer time periodst jS
                          However, price s of stocks with limited liability can't  ever go negative
Some financial variables cango negative, such as cash flows (CFs) of a company
If CFs  << 0, company may go bankrupt or go out of business 
Nevertheless, a cash flow model could be reasonably modeled using the ARW.
19
Another possible application for the ARW is a “basis”:
Basis = difference between two prices.  For example:
S = West Texas (WTI) oil price minus North Sea (Brent) oil price
The difference canbecome negative, like CFs.
This fact seems to support using the ARW to model a basis.
On the other hand, as  j , the standard d eviation of an ARW process ;  
i.e., the standard deviation of  increases indefinitely as the square root of ti me.t jj
S
  
But we wouldn't expect the difference be tween two prices to increase inefinitely .
Instead, we'd expect there to be a relat ionship between the two prices drawing 
them back together over time. 
We'd like to construct a model that can reflect such long-term joint relationshi ps
between two RVs.
To achieve this we now consider a differ ent process that is mean-reverting.

1121MeanReversion and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck(OU) Process
Non-stochastic analogue of the OU stochastic process is the j-thsummand of the 
mean-reverting perpetuity from Chapter 2.  Recall from Chapter 2 that
1( )t t tS S S    
where  = long-run mean of the process
and 0 1  represents the speed of mean re version  
22Personal note:  I find it more intuitive to subtract times the deviation from the 
mean, i.e.,
1( )t t tS S S    
or alternatively to express the (t + 1)stdeviation from the meanin terms of the 
tthdeviation from the mean:
1 ( )t t tS S S       
1(1 )( )t tS S     21
22

4/15/2025
1223Of course all of these expressions are completely equivalent and just a matter of taste!
Also recall from Chapter 2 that iteration on the index in the last expression leads to the 
following more general formula for St+j:
1 (1 )( )t j t jS S       
2
2 (1 ) ( )t jS     
3
3 (1 ) ( )t jS     
...
(1 ) ( )j
t j jS     
(1 ) ( )j
tS   
24which can also be written as
(1 ) ( )j
t j tS S     
Recall the following implications of this formula:
If  = 0,
(1 ) ( ) ( )j
t j t t tS S S S           
which implies that  is constant, so ther e is no mean reversion!t jS
If  = 1,
(1 ) ( )j
t j tS S       
which for j = 1 implies
1,   so there is 100% mean reversion in o ne period!tS23
24

4/15/2025
1325The more interesting case is when 0 < < 1, in which case
lim ( )lim(1 ) 0j
t j tj jS S           
i.e., the process converges to the long run mean.
It’s also easily seen that 
when the starting point St> µ, Stdrifts monotonically downward toward µ
when the starting point St< µ, Stdrifts monotonically upward toward µ
St 
                                                                                                                                                                                                 drifts negatively toward µ     
µ  
                                                                                                                            drifts postively toward µ

1 1(1 )( )t t tS S Z        

(1 ) ( )j
t j tS S      (1 ) ( )j

For the stochastic OU process and j = 1, 
1 1(1 )( )t t tS S Z         which implies that

One finds (again similar to the ARW but with a bit more work) that the lower triangular 
decomposition matrix
R has ones on the diagonal, and entries below the diagonal shrinking at a constant rate of .

2345Additional comments on OU process:
Recall that
2
lim [ ]    and    limVar[ ](2 )t j t jj jE S S    
and neither of these limits depends on the starting value St.
This means that the long term mean and 2-standard deviation
confidence interval around future values of St+jdon’t depend
upon the specific trajectory/path; see the text diagram.
46In view of its convergence to the mean, the OU process is
a natural choice for modeling the WTI –Brent oil basis mentioned
earlier, or for modeling interest rates (assuming that there will be
reversion to a mean).
The OU process is not suitable for modeling stock prices or stock indices,
because that would imply there is a predictable long term mean value
irrespective of the current trajectory/path, which doesn’t match market
expectations (our best source for what is “true”).  
Therefore, for stock prices or stock indices, a different model is needed.45

Assume that the current price of corn is St= $5, the long run mean price is µ= 
$4, the speed of mean reversion is = 20% per year, and the price volatility is σ= 
$0.75 per year.  
Calculate the expected value, variance and standard deviation of the average of

2651Geometric Random Walk (GRW)
We have seen that neither the ARW process nor the OU process is suitable for 
modeling stock prices or stock indices over the long term.  
For both processes, the forecast variables St+jare normally distributed, which 
means there is a non-zero probability that St+jwill be a negative value, 
whereas limited liability means that this will never happen.  
In addition, the OU process implies that there is a predictable long term 
mean price, irrespective of the current price, and this isn’t consistent with 
market expectations.
Sothe ARW process has one strike against it, and 
the OU process, although it has some attractive features, has two strikes 
against it.  
Let’s go back to the ARW process (“one of the simplest of all stochastic 
processes”), andtry to see where we went wrong.
52With the benefit of hindsight, we can spot the problem in the very first step, i.e., 
the defining equation:
1 1 ,  because this implies that t t tS S Z     

2753Rather than modeling the forecast variable St+jas the starting price Stplus a cumulative 
sum of historical one-period dollar price differences as we did for the ARW:

we could instead try modeling the forecast variable St+jas the starting price Sttimes a 
cumulative product of historical one-period percentage price increases (i.e., as the 
starting price times the percentage investment return accumulation factors):

and follow the pattern we used for the ARW, we might now be tempted to make 
the assumptionthat the effective annual rate (EAR) of investment return r as 
calculated above is a normal random variable.
But this won’t do, because we would end up with the same problem we had 
before, i.e., that St+1can go negative, or equivalently that the EAR r could be 
less than -100%.  
A negative return of less than -100% would mean that you could lose more 
than the amount Styou invested, which shouldn’t be possible if there is limited 
liability.
To see if there is a way out of this dilemma, let’s first recall the basic facts about 
interest compounded continuously from Chapter 3.  
53
54

4/15/2025
2855To differentiate the continuously compounded rate from the effective annual rate 
EAR, we’ll use the force of interest symbol δfor the continuously compounded rate.
1) The continuously compounded rate δin terms of the EAR r is given by:
log(1 )r  
2) The EAR r in terms of the continuously compounded rate δ is given by:
1r e 
3) The one-year (or more generally one-period) accumulation factor in terms of δ is 
given by:
lim 1m
mem
    
56What is interesting about item (2) is that we can see that no matter how 
negative the continuously compounded rate δ may be, the corresponding 
EAR r will never be less than -100% (in fact it will always be greater than -
100%), by properties of the exponential function. 
Item (3) also provides some intuitive understanding of why the one-period 
accumulation factor can never be negative, because even if δ is a very 
large negative value, for m large enough (δ/m) will be greater than -1 (i.e., 
greater than -100%).  
From another perspective, only EARs greater than -100% have equivalent 
continuously compounded rates δ.

simulating Σt+jvalues under the ARW using the methods discussed in the first 
section of Chapter 6, and then simply setting St+j= exp(Σt+j). 
One might think that we are finished.  However, there is actually oneadjustment 
that is customarily made to completely develop the final GRW methodology.

70In summary,
The best model for security prices is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which is 
the GRW with an infinitesimal time step dt.  Advantages of this model include:
It ensures prices can never become negative (limited liability);
A constant proportional dividend rate can be subtracted from the drift to obtain post-
dividend simulations
Disadvantages of this model include:
It assumes constant expected returns and volatility;
It doesn’t allow security values to reach zero in the event of bankruptcy or termination
It does not allow negatively skewed or leptokurtic returns in the simple version
(Negatively skewed means sudden drops in price are more likely than sudden rises.  A 
leptokurtic distribution has kurtosis greater than the normal distribution = 3; leptokurtic 
returns have probability of extreme returns greater than for a normal distribution, i.e., the 
distribution has fat tails.)

3671Best model for commodity prices and interest rates is the mean reverting process.
Commodities aren’t assets in the financial sense.  
High commodity prices a) stimulate production and b) reduce demand leading to 
expectation of lower prices in the future.
If you try to short commodities (i.e., sell now at a higher price for delivery in the 
future at a lower price) you would find no market for short sales
Low commodity prices a) reduce production and b) stimulate demand leading to 
expectation of higher prices in the future.
Interest rates resemble commodities, since high rate encourage lending and 
discourage borrowing, i.e., stimulate production and reduce demand, leading to 
expectation of lower rates in the future.
Finally, in many financial models volatility is assumed to change over time, and this 
happens in a mean reverting process.
72The ABM process which is the ARW with an infinitesimal time step dt, can be used 
to model most financial variables over the short term, but generally fails long-term 
due to
The possibility of negative values, and
Increasing volatility over time.
So the main function of the ABM/ARW process at this point is to provide a 
foundation for the OU mean reverting process and the GMB/GRW process.

1Valuation for Financial Engineering  --textbook by David C. Shimko
Chapter 7: Risk, Capital and Valuation
In Chapter 7, we will study 
how risk is measured, 
how risk affects required returns, 
how risk relates to capital, and 
how risk affects asset valuations.
Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --2-24-2020 textbook draft by David C. Shimko4/16/2024 1
What is meant by “risk”?
In previous chapters we valued life contingent insurance benefits and defaultable 
corporate bonds.  To determine their risk-adjusted values, we discounted the 
expected or promised cashflows at the risk-free interest rate plus an adjustment
such as π, δ, κ+πλ orθ+πλ, as appropriate depending on the circumstances.
When cash flows are contingent, the discount rate (required return) is frequently 
higherthan the risk-free rate to compensate the investor for the extra risk he/she is 
taking on.
However, the discount rate (required return) for contingent cash flows can also be 
lowerthan the risk-free rate.  For example, put options used to insure an 
investment portfolio may be more highly valued (have a lower required return) 
because the put option cash flows are negatively correlated to portfolio cash flows, 
helping to reduce the risk of the portfolio.

Engineering  --2-24-2020 textbook draft by David C. Shimko21

4/19/2025
2What is meant by “risk” (continued)?
The total dollar risk of a portfolio of positively but not perfectly correlated risks 
increases with each risky asset added, but the risk per dollar invested declines.  Hence 
diversification (holding of a broad-based portfolio with many types of assets) can 
reduce the risk of percentage returns..
A financial analyst must choose their definition of risk, and ensure that their risk 
measures reflect the choice.
Companies may value risky projects one way, and shareholders may value them 
another way.
Financial companies approach the problem differently than nonfinancial companies.
Companies may value risk differently from other companies, depending on shareholder 
preferences.
This chapter provides tools to value all sorts of risky cash flows in many different 
situations, regardless of how risk is measured and translated into risk charges and 
project valuations.

Asymmetric Risks
Risks may be assessed differently between two parties entering into a transaction.
Example:  Fixed monthly payment for life received under an annuity contract.
From the annuity purchaser’s perspective, the risks include such things as:
Risk of failure of insurance company to make payments if it defaults in the future
Risk of reduced payments, delayed payments, or non-payment by state guaranty 
associations 
Risk of annuitant dying too soon to collect enough annuity payments to offset 
purchase price (mortality risk)
Risk of higher inflation lowering the spending power of fixed annuity payments
Risk of living longer than expected without income, if annuity isn’t purchased 
(longevity risk)

3Asymmetric Risks, continued
But from the insurance company’s perspective, the risks include such things as:
Risk of increased longevity of some or all annuitants, e.g., from medical advances
Risk of lower-than-expected interest and inflation rates
Risk of higher-than-expected expenses or corporate taxes
Risk of inaccurate pricing models, assumptions, or methodologies
Unanticipated usage of embedded options
Contract holder persistency risk for annual premium annuities

Engineering  --2-24-2020 textbook draft by David C. Shimko5
Insurance can be viewed as an asset for the customer and a liability for the insurer:
Customer is willing pay a premium over expected value of the contract in order to 
reduce the risk of living without income
Insurance company must charge a premium over the expected value of the 
contract in order to provide for its risk, accumulate surplus and earn a profit

4How is Risk Measured?
Measures of symmetric variation / deviations from the mean:
Standard deviation
Mean absolute deviation
Measures of downside variation:
Downside standard deviation
Downside mean absolute deviation
Worst case outcome relative to expected

5Of the above measures,
Standard deviation is most widely used because of mathematical properties
Mean absolute deviation not widely used because it presents analytical 
challenges
Downside risk measures used in asset management to make better investment 
decisions, because 
oupside risk isn’t bad
oderivative overlays cause return distributions to be asymmetric

One can also find related measures used in practice, such as the “semivariance” 
and “semideviation.”
There are many other possible measures of risk used in practice.  
For example, an important measure used in actuarial practice is the conditional tail 
expectation, or CTE, defined as the expected loss given that the loss falls in the worst 
(1 − α) part of the loss distribu Ɵon

9The first method (discount expected CF a t risk-adjusted discount rate) is more p opular, but 
second method (discount certainty-equivalent CF = expected CF less risk charge at the

For example, it would be difficult to de fine the risk premium  as a constant per centage
of the investment value for short and derivative positions.

they are all consistent with the GVE.

Revisiting “Return”
Consider the following examples discussed way back in Chapter 1:
Suppose an investor buys a share of stock for $20 and the price rises to $21.
Gain = $21 -$20 = $1
% return = $1/$20 = 5%
Now suppose the investor sells short a share of stock for $20 and the price rises to $21.
Loss = $21 -$20 = $1
% return = -$1/$0 is undefined!  
No initial investment means no denominator for the return calculation
We would have the same problem calculating % returns for forwards and futures 
positions
Thus calculating % returns for undercapitalized (or non-capitalized) investments can be 
frustrating.
But calculating % returns can also be frustrating for fully-capitalized investments!

10Consider the following example from Dr. Shimko’stext book:
Let’s suppose you want to invest $100.  It looks like you can expect to make higher 
dollar and % returns by investing in the startup company.
4/16/2024Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --2-24-2020 textbook draft by David C. Shimko19
However, consider this:
You can buy $500 worth of the blue-chip stock by investing $100 of your own money and taking a 
loan for the remaining $400.  In the worst-case scenario (because it’s a blue-chip stock), the 
value of the blue-chip stock will decline to 80% of $500, or $400, which will fully repay the loan 
on a risk-free basis.  Moreover, you can expect a return of 10% x $500 = $50, which can be 
viewed as a return of 50% on your capital investment of $100.
On the other hand, you can only buy $100 worth of the start-up company stock by investing $100 
of your own money.  The start-up company stock cannot be used as risk-free collateral for 
repaying the loan, because in the worst-case scenario its value may decline to $0.
The actual capital required for one share of the blue-chip stock is $20, since the remaining $80 
can be financed on a risk-free basis, whereas the actual capital required for one share of the 
startup company is $100.
In general, overcapitalized investments can be divided into one portion that is considered risky 
and another portion that is considered risk-free.
This differs sharply from the traditional approach, which attributes the entire return on 
investment to the level of cash deployed.

11Example:  Assume a $100 investment in the S&P, with expected return of 12% = $12, 
expected return on T-bills (risk-free rate) = 6%, worst case loss of 25% = $25.
The GVE implies
Time Value of Money + Risk Compensation = Total Expected Return
6% x $100 + Risk Compensation = $12
Risk Compensation = $12 -$6 = $6.
4/16/2024Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --2-24-2020 textbook draft by David C. Shimko21
Under the traditional way of thinking, the capital investment = the entire $100 of cash 
deployed, hence the % return on risk capital would be viewed as being only 
Risk Compensation/Risk Capital = $6/$100 = 6%.
Under the new way of thinking (aka “risk capital formulation” in the text), the risk capital 
= the $25 actually at risk, hence the % return on risk capital would be viewed as being 
Risk Compensation/Risk Capital = $6/$25 = 24%.
In other words, under the traditional way of thinking, the $6 risk compensation is 
attributed to the full $100 investment, whereas under the new way of thinking, it is 
attributed only to the $25 risky portion of the investment.

12This section of the text closes with the following remarks:
A firm that maximizes return may be doing its shareholders a disservice, because 
return is normalized to the amount of capital employed. 
A smaller return on a higher capital base may add significant value to shareholders, 
and therefore, firms should look to value-added rather than return on capital as a 
measure of performance. 
The only time it makes sense to maximize return on capital is when capital is the 
limited resource. This is sometimes the case in the real world. 
However, under the perfect markets assumptions of traditional finance theory, 
unlimited capital is available from shareholders as long as a competitive return is 
earned. 
For this reason, real world practices often differ from recommendations of financial 
theory.

Risk Capital and RAROC
Risk capital = estimated maximum dollar amount put at risk in an investment
= maximum likely loss
= statistic which may be unrelated to the cash invested
Example:  Short sale of stock at $20, then price rises to $21
Assume the maximum likely loss = $10
Then %return on risk capital = -$1/$10 = -10%
Example: Long position on oil contract, forward price = $100, actual price = $101
Assume the maximum likely loss = $5
The %return on risk capital = $1/$5 = 20%

Sharpe Ratio
The Sharpe Ratio can be viewed as:
Cost of risk capital
Return on risk capital
The most important measure of investment performance
oWhy might one anticipate this to be the case?
oBecause the ratio is measuring return per unit of risk
oWhat could be more important than that????  
The Sharpe ratio can be calculated:
On a prospective (i.e., looking forward into the future) basis;
On a retrospective (i.e., looking backward into the past) basis.

Note:
Sometimes we have used bold letters, cap ital letters, or tildas (aka "wiggle 
signs") to distinguish random variables (i.e., real-valued functions on a 
probability space) from scalars such as expected values or random numbers.  
However, this is not always done in prac tice (e.g., in Dr. Shimko's text book, i n other 
resources, or IN THESE LECTURE SLIDES, b ecause it sometimes gets too tedious).  
Hence please be sure to sharply distingu ish  between random 
variables (RVs) and their expected values based on the context, even if the

15For less than fully capitalized investme nts, it is preferable to work with a
"dollarized" version of the Sharpe Ratio  which has the same interpretation:

Thus the dollarized Sharpe Ratio can als o be interpreted as the cost of risk " " 
in the GVE if the risk measure is the standard deviation of the cash flow, CF
In addition, it's IMPORTANT TO NOTE that  in this "dollarized" version
of the Sharpe Ratio,
             the numerator = expected ca pital gain + expected cash flow - financ ing costs,
             the denominator = risk meas ure,

We can continue this line of reasoning t o confirm that, similar to the dollarize d 
Sharpe Ratio, the percentage Sharpe Rati o is equivalent to the cost of risk " " 
from the GVE.  To do this we need to k
eep two things clearly in mind:
First, that the expected investment retu rn  on the investment includes 
both the expected capital gain/loss and expected cash flow components 
of the return, that is:ir

Assumptions for a classical example from Modigliani and Miller:

     The company can finance the risky a sset up to $  at the 
       risk-free rate D

so their equity . E A
With leverage however, 
     The investors' equity is the remain ing value after deducting the 
        risk-free debt,  
 
      Some portion  of the asset's total return  must be used to service

20From this we can make SEVERAL IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS:
  The Sharpe Ratio of an investment is i nvariant to the level of risk-free finan cing; 
  The expected % return of a levered inv estment increases with the amount of lev erage: 

  Hence the expected return in the numer ator increases by just the amount needed  
    relative to the increase in the standard deviation of returns in the denomin ator to 
    keep the Sharpe ratio of t
he levered investment constant and equal  to the Sharpe 
    ratio of the unlevered investment.

Until now, we’ve calculated conditional expectations E[Y|X=x] of random variable 
Y given that another random variable X = x, where X and Y have a specified joint 
distribution.  
Equivalently, you could say that we’ve calculated the expectation E[Y|X=x] of a 
random variable “Y|X=x.” 
Like any expected value of a random variable, E[Y|X=x] is a scalar.  Thus if we wanted 
to be pedantic, we could call E[Y|X=x] a “conditional expectation scalar.”
Since X is a random variable, it can be viewed as a real-valued function X( ) on a 
probability space .

34Risk Benchmarks:  Single Factor Models
The idea of a risk benchmark arises when some of the investment risk of an asset iis 
unpriced, but the other part is correlated with a priced risk factor.
Define:
   risk free rate   (note:  sometimes in  the literature the symbol used is  )f r r
  return on asset iir
 total return of the benchmark assetmr
It is customary to consider the excess returns over the risk-free rate as random variables, 
and to consider the risk-free rate as a given constant value.  
4/16/2024Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --2-24-2020 textbook draft by David C. Shimko67
Following the text, assume that the excess returns are jointly normally distributed 
random variables with correlation .  Thus, in terms of our review of the bivariate 
normal distribution and regression, identify
  with the dependent random variable  ir r Y
  with the independent or explanatory ra ndom variable mr r X
and define:
standard deviation of  i i r r    standard deviation of ir 

Note:  In the literature, instead of " " and " " you will often see the symbols
" " and " ."  a b

We know that " " or " " represents the slo pe of the regression line, the 
amount of vertical movement (i.e., exces s stock return) on average per 
unit of horizontal movement (i.e., per unit of excess mab
rket return).
We know that " " or " " represents the y-i ntercept (or in this case, the " - " 
intercept) of the regression line, the a mount of excess stock return, on average , 
independent of the excess market returi a r r
n.  It therefore measures the "specific"  
component of the stock's excess returns.
4/16/2024Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --2-24-2020 textbook draft by David C. Shimko71
If " " or " "  is assumed to be zero (for example, sometimes it is argued that ind ividual stocks 
with a positive alpha tend to be offset by other stocks with a negative alpha), one arrives at
the famoua
s Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) equation:
                                                             i mE r r E r r   
 Note:  Sometimes you will see this without the expectation symbols:    i mr r r r  
In the CAPM, "m" refers to the universe of investable assets, i.e., to the marke t.  However,
the same equation can also be applied to pricing relative to other portfolios, i n which case
this is referred to as the market model.  Dr. Shimko's t ext refers to this class of models as
"benchmarked return models."
The CAPM equation can also be viewed as an expression of the GVE:
Required Return =  Expected Return
  (Time Value of Money) + (Risk Measure or  ) x (Price of Risk or )  =  Expected Re turn

37Finally, there is a correspondence betwe en the CAPM equation and the Sharpe Rati o.

is the benchmark (i.e., systematic) risk.  In other words, for purposes of calcu lating the 
Sharpe Ratio the idiosyncratic risk can be ignored and the price d variance of the asset's
return as we saw previously is given by 2 2 2 2          i i m mVar r b Var r b   
If we now assert that an asset's risk pr emium relative to its priced standard de viation 
of return must be the same as that of th e benchmark asset considered on its own,  
we must have

Thus, the Sharpe Ratio has been successf ully used to derive the CAPM equation.

Pricing Cash Flows in a Single Factor Risk Model
Objective:  Consolidate the last few sections and use the benchmark model to value 
cash flows in a singlebenchmark model.  
Assume the cash flow CF is a random variable whichis normally distributed as before:

39Unfortunately, this formula requires us to know the covariance between the asset 's 
return and the market return.
Fortunately, we can write this covarianc e in terms of the covariance between the  
cash flow and the market return, which w e may be able to estimate, particularly 
when we have cash flows over multiple p eriods (as we will see in the next secti on).
0To do this, we simply need to recall tha t when considered as an RV, the random 
investment return  is the total return at which the initial investment  will 
accumulate to the investment payoff amouir V

What is the expected current value of the unknown income in one year, using the

Chapter 8: The Single Period CAPM and CFPM
5/6/2025Introduction
Note how far we have come:
In the firstpart of the course, we only valued assets for which either:
We assumed that there was no risk , or
We assumed that there was risk, but we discounted expected cash flows (CFs) at 
assumed rates of return
In contrast, nowwe want to figure out appropriate discount rates to value risky CFs.
Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko2CAPM stands for “Capital Asset Pricing Model”
CAPM denotes the contemporary approach following Sharpe (1964), which 
takes the investor’s point of view and focuses on asset returns given prices, 
rather than asset valuation given cash flows (CFs)
CAPM relies on a framework pioneered by Harry Markowitz, a University of 
Chicago PhD student of the Nobel economist Milton Friedman in 1952, which 
assumes a number of assets with known expected percentage returns and 
standard deviations.  
But we know from the first part of the course that when assets aren’t fully 
funded, percentage returns sometimes can’t be calculated (or if they can be 
calculated, are not very intuitive)!

Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko3CFPM stands for “Cash Flow Portfolio Model”
CFPM denotes the Lintner-Mossincash flow based version of CAPM, which 
assumes that all assets produce normally distributed liquidating cash flows in 
one period.  
In this chapter we will cover:
Portfolio mathematics
How to price risky CFs based on their relationship to the risks of a portfolio
How investors’ risk aversion translates into required RORs/discount rates on CFs
Equilibrium expected return and return covariance matrix
Variance utility, standard deviation utility, or exponential utility, which all CAPM 
pricing equations
Computation of equilibrium asset prices and portfolio holdings
5/6/2025
Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko4Note that CFPM also provides linear subportfolio pricing relationships:
Any subportfoliocan be priced relative to any other subportfolio
Hence dollar returns on securities can be benchmarked to correlated assets,                       
not just to a single market portfolio of all securities (as typically done under CAPM)

model applies the market clearing supply condition to determine asset values.
In the text, Dr. Shimkosummarizes the results for both the variance and the standard 
deviation utility models, but then subsequently focuses on the variance model.
Conclusions for the two models are identical, except for a change in scale of the risk 
aversion parameter.
The standard deviation model is included to allow risk to be measured in the same 
units as the cash flows, and to allow the model to be easily calibrated to market-
determined Sharpe ratios.19

Recall the following assumptions of our model:
Unlimited cash is held or borrowed by each investor as needed to purchase their 
assets.
All assets can be bought or sold in unlimited quantities.
All investors have the same information and agree on the cash flow risk parameters
All investors have the same utility functions for wealth.
Investors differ only in their initial levels of wealth and risk aversion
As a result,
More risk averse investors take smaller positions in the risky assets, and vice versa; 
However, regardless of their wealth, they each invest in the same relative 
proportionsof each of the risky assets27
28

5/6/2025
15Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko29 5/6/2025They choose the same relative proportions because such proportions provide the 
best risk/reward tradeoff of all of the possible combinations of the assets.
All assets can be bought or sold without restriction, although in equilibrium all 
positively valued assets are held.
Because all investors invest in the same portfolio, albeit at different scales, it makes 
sense to define this portfolio as the common benchmark, or market portfolio .
In this setup, the market portfolio is represented by one unit of every asset, hence 
in the aggregate, the asset holding vector is an N x 1 vector of 1s (which we had 
symbolized by “J”)
In other words, in equilibrium, the total sale of each of the i=  1, 2, …, N firms 
security offerings must be 100%, which means its value viin the N x 1 asset holdings 
vector must be equal to 1.Valuation with Market Clearing (vector of initial security prices/values V), cont’d:
Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko30 5/6/2025The requirement that = 1 can be thought of as a market clearing condition , since 
the optimal holdings in an economy in equilibrium must reflect the total actual 
investments
Investors’ demand for the risky cash flows is a function of the N x 1 price vector V, 
and in equilibrium the prices must be set to clear the market, that is, all securities 
offered need to be priced so that they are 100% sold.  Note that this is the only 
constraint in the CFPM model.
Based on this model constraint and the preceding formulas, we can now derive 
the equilibrium asset values V as follows:Valuation with Market Clearing (vector of initial security prices/values V), cont’d:29

Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko72SubportfolioPricing in the CFPM
Under traditional CAPM, relationships among security returns are defined by their mutual 
connection to the market (reference) portfolio
“Systematic risk” = security’s risk correlated with the market
“Idiosyncratic risk” = security’s risk uncorrelated with the market
The CFPM makes it clear that 
oidiosyncratic risks can be highly correlated, and 
osecurity covariances are priced into the reference portfolio: 1A JVr 
In this section we explore how we can use the security covariance structure to price any 
subportfolioof the reference portfolio relative to any other (nondegenerate) 
subportfolioof the reference portfolio.71

Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko81Before we leave this topic (until meetin g it again in Chapter 9), it is very int eresting
to note that a simple rearrangement of the formula
   1Y YX X
Y YX XV Vrto   1Y YX X
Y YX XV Vr
 suggests that by buying subportfolio Y and selling  units of subportfolio X (as 
represented by the left side of the equation), we can construct a "risk free" po rtfolio
having zero covariance with thYX
e reference portfolio, which can be valued simply 
by discounting the mean returns (w/o subtracting any risk charge) at the risk fr ee rate.
I.e., the "certainty equivalent" in the numerator is simply the mean dollarized 
return of the portfolio thus constructed!
5/6/2025Prof. Lessing Lecture Based on Valuation for Financial 
Engineering  --1-11-2021 textbook draft by David C. Shimko82In fact we can easily verify that the co variance of the constructed portfolio 
does indeed have a zero covariance with the reference portfolio, as follows:

Of course the weights of such portfolios  must sum to 1, so we have another

The Cash Flow Portfolio Model (CFPM) can be used to value derivatives with linear payoffs
What about derivatives like options with nonlinear payout functions?
We will use the CFPM to derive the Black-Scholes option valuation formula without 
assuming continuous costless trading
Mathematical Intro to Financial Derivatives
For purposes of this chapter, Dr. Shimkomakes the following abstract definition of a financial 
derivative:
A financial derivative is a contract for which the end-of-period payoff is a possibly 
nonlinear function of the end-of period value of the assets in the reference portfolio 
(unlike chapter 8).
Assumption:  The reference portfolio assets have been priced.
Objective:  Find today’s value of the derivative.
