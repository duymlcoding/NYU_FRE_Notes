WHAT IS A DERIVATIVE?
A derivative is an instrument whose value depends on, or is derived 
from, the value of another asset.
Examples: futures, forwards, swaps, options
1

WHY DERIVATIVES ARE IMPORTANT
Derivatives play a key role in transferring risks in the economy
The underlying assets include stocks, currencies, interest rates, 
commodities, debt instruments, electricity prices, insurance 
payouts, the weather
Many financial transactions have embedded derivatives
2

HOW DERIVATIVES ARE TRADED
On exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
In the over -the-counter (OTC) market where traders working for banks, 
fund managers and corporate treasurers contact each other directly
3

THE OTC MARKET
Largely unregulated prior to 2008
Banks acted as market makers quoting bids and asks
Master agreements usually defined how transactions between 
two parties would be handled
Some transactions were cleared through central counterparties 
(CCPs). A CCP stands between the two sides to a transaction in 
the same way that an exchange does
4

SINCE 2008
OTC market has become regulated. Objectives:
Reduce systemic risk
Increase transparency
In the U.S and some other countries, standardized OTC products 
must be traded on swap execution facilities (SEFs) which are 
electronic platforms similar to exchanges
CCPs must be used to clear standardized transactions between 
financial institutions in most countries
All trades must be reported to a central repository
5

HOW DERIVATIVES ARE USED
To hedge risks
To speculate (take a view on the future direction of the market)
To lock in an arbitrage profit
To change the nature of a liability
To change the nature of an investment without incurring the 
costs of selling one portfolio and buying another
6

FORWARD PRICE
The forward price for a contract is the delivery price that would 
be applicable to the contract if were negotiated today (i.e., it is 
the delivery price that would make the contract worth exactly 
zero)
The forward price may be different  for contracts of different 
maturities
7

TERMINOLOGY
The party that has agreed to buy has what is termed a 
long position
The party that has agreed to sell has what is termed a 
short position
8

EXAMPLE
On May 21, 2020, the treasurer of a corporation enters into a long 
forward contract to buy £1 million in six months at an exchange rate 
of 1.2230
This obligates the corporation to pay $1,223,000 for £1 million on 
November 21, 2020
What are the possible outcomes?

FUTURES CONTRACTS
Agreement to buy or sell an asset for a certain price at a certain time
Similar to forward contract
Whereas a forward contract is traded OTC, a futures contract is traded 
on an exchange
12

EXCHANGES TRADING FUTURES
CME Group (formed when Chicago Mercantile Exchange and 
Chicago Board of Trade merged)
InterContinental Exchange
B3 (Brazil)
Tokyo Financial Exchange (Tokyo )
13

EXAMPLES OF FUTURES CONTRACTS
Agreement to:
Buy 100 oz. of gold @ US$1800/oz. in December 
Sell £62,500 @ 1.2500 US$/£ in March
Sell 1,000 bbl. of oil @ US$40/bbl. in April
14

FORWARD PRICE OF A NON -DIVIDEND 
PAYING STOCK
If the spot price is S and the forward  price for a contract 
deliverable in T  years is F, then
 F = S (1+r )T 
 where r is the 1 -year (domestic currency) risk -free rate of 
interest .
15

OPTIONS
A call option is an option to buy a certain asset by a certain date for 
a certain price (the strike price)
A put option is an option to sell a certain asset by a certain date for a 
certain price (the strike price)
16

AMERICAN VS EUROPEAN OPTIONS
An American option can be exercised at any time during its life
A European option can be exercised only at maturity 
17

OPTIONS VS FUTURES/FORWARDS
A futures/forward contract gives the holder the obligation to buy or 
sell at a certain price
An option gives the holder the right to buy or sell at a certain price
18

TYPES OF TRADERS
Hedgers
Speculators
Arbitrageurs
19

HEDGING EXAMPLES 
A US company will pay £10 million for imports from Britain in 3 months 
and decides to hedge using a long position in a forward contract
An investor owns 1,000 shares currently worth $28 per share. A two -
month put with a strike price of $27.50 costs $1. The investor decides to 
hedge by buying 10 contracts

DANGERS
Traders can switch from being hedgers to speculators
It is important to set up controls to ensure that trades are using 
derivatives in for their intended purpose
22

HEDGE FUNDS
Hedge funds are not subject to the same rules as mutual 
funds and cannot offer their securities publicly. 
Mutual funds must 
disclose investment policies, 
make shares redeemable at any time,
limit use of leverage
Hedge funds are not subject to these constraints.
Hedge funds use complex trading strategies and are big 
users of derivatives for hedging, speculation and arbitrage

QUESTION 1
Describe the profit from the following portfolio: a long forward 
contract on an asset and a long European put option on the asset 
with the same maturity as the forward contract and a strike price 
that is equal to the forward price of the asset at the time the 
portfolio is set up.

QUESTION 2
A bond issued by an Oil company worked as follows. At the bond’s maturity 
the company promised to pay $1,000 plus an additional amount based on 
the price of oil at that time. The additional amount was equal to the excess 
(if any) of the price of a barrel of oil at maturity over $25.
The maximum additional amount paid was $100 (which corresponds to a 
barrel price of $125)
Show that the bond is a combination of a regular bond, a long position in 
call options on oil with a strike price of $25, and a short position in call 
options on oil with a strike price of $125.

FUTURES CONTRACTS
Available on a wide range of assets
Exchange traded
Specifications need to be defined:
What can be delivered,
Where it can be delivered, & 
When it can be delivered
Settled daily
1

MARGINS
A margin is cash or marketable securities deposited by an 
investor with his or her broker
The balance in the margin account is adjusted to reflect daily 
settlement
Margins minimize the possibility of a loss through a default on 
a contract
2

MARGIN CASH FLOWS
A retail trader has to bring the balance in the margin 
account up to the initial margin when it falls below 
the maintenance margin level
A member of the exchange clearing house only has 
an initial margin and is required to maintain the 
balance in its account at that level every day.
These daily margin cash flows are referred to as 
variation margin
A member of the exchange is also required to 
contribute to a default fund
3

EXAMPLE OF A FUTURES TRADE
A retail trader takes a long position in 2 December gold 
futures contracts on June 5
contract size is 100 oz.
futures price is US$1,750
initial margin requirement is US$6,000/contract (US$12,000 in total)
maintenance margin is US$4,500/contract (US$9,000 in total)

Volume of trading:  the number of trades in one day
6

KEY POINTS ABOUT FUTURES
They are settled daily
Closing out a futures position involves entering into an 
offsetting trade
Most contracts are closed out before maturity
7

DELIVERY
If a futures contract is not closed out before maturity, it is usually 
settled by delivering the assets underlying the contract. When there 
are alternatives about what is delivered, where it is delivered, and 
when it is delivered, the party with the short position chooses.
  A few contracts (for example, those on stock indices and Eurodollars) 
are settled in cash

CLEARING VS CENTRAL CLEARING
10
CC
CC
CPCCP

BILATERALLY CLEARED DERIVATIVES 
TRANSACTIONS
Usually governed by an ISDA Master agreement with a credit 
support annex (CSA)
The agreement explains the rights of one party if the other 
party defaults
The CSA defines the collateral which must be posted
If one party defaults, the other party is entitled to keep any 
collateral that has been posted up to what is necessary to 
settle its claims
Traditionally CSAs have required variation margin but not 
initial margin (e.g., LTCM in Business Snapshot 2.2)
11

POST -CRISIS REGULATIONS 1
Standard transactions between financial institutions must be cleared 
through CCPs
Non-standard transactions can be cleared bilaterally
A transaction with a non -financial corporation can be cleared 
bilaterally
12

POST -CRISIS REGULATIONS 2
New regulations for non -standard trades between financial 
institutions that are not cleared centrally require the financial 
institutions to have CSAs where both initial margin and 
variation margin are posted
The initial margin is posted with a third party
13

THE FORWARD PRICE
If the spot price of an investment asset that provides no income 
is S0and the futures price for a contract deliverable in Tyears is 
F0, then
F0= S0erT
where ris the T-year risk -free rate of interest.
1

WHEN AN INVESTMENT ASSET PROVIDES A 
KNOWN YIELD
F0 = S0 e(r–q )T      
   where q is the average yield during the life of the contract 
(expressed with continuous compounding)
2

VALUING A FORWARD CONTRACT
A forward contract is worth zero (except for bid -offer spread effects) 
when it is first negotiated
Later it may have a positive or negative value
Suppose that K is the delivery price and F0 is the forward price for a 
contract  that would be negotiated today
3

VALUING A FORWARD CONTRACT
By considering the difference between a contract with delivery 
price K and a contract with delivery price F0 we can deduce that:
the value of a long forward contract is                                    
 (F0 – K )e–rT         
the value of a short forward contract is 
   (K – F0 )e–rT
4

FORWARD VS FUTURES PRICES
Future Price : Expected price of the underlying as of the delivery date
A strong positive correlation between interest rates and the asset 
price implies the futures price is slightly higher than the forward price
A strong negative correlation implies the reverse 
5

STOCK INDEX
Can be viewed as an investment asset paying a dividend yield
The futures price and spot price relationship is therefore 
 
                F0 = S0 e(r–q )T     
   where q is the average dividend yield on the portfolio 
represented by the index during life of contract
6

STOCK INDEX (CONTINUED)
For the formula to be true it is important that the index represent an 
investment asset
In other words, changes in the index must correspond to changes in 
the value of a tradable portfolio
7

INDEX ARBITRAGE
When F0 > S0e(r-q)T an arbitrageur buys the stocks underlying 
the index and sells futures
When F0 < S0e(r-q)T an arbitrageur buys futures and shorts or 
sells the stocks underlying the index
8

INDEX ARBITRAGE
(CONTINUED)
Index arbitrage involves simultaneous trades in 
futures and many different stocks 
Very often a computer is used to generate the 
trades 
Occasionally simultaneous trades are not 
possible and the theoretical no -arbitrage 
relationship between F0 and S0 does not hold
9

FUTURES AND FORWARDS ON 
CURRENCIES
A foreign currency is analogous to a security providing a yield
The yield is the foreign risk -free interest rate
It follows that if rf  is the foreign risk -free interest rate

CONSUMPTION ASSETS: STORAGE IS 
NEGATIVE INCOME
F0  S0 e(r+u )T
 where u is the storage cost per unit time as a percent of the 
asset value.
  
11

CONSUMPTION VS INVESTMENT ASSETS
Investment assets are assets held by significant numbers of 
people purely for investment purposes (Examples: gold, silver)
Consumption assets are assets held primarily for consumption 
(Examples: copper, oil)
12

THE COST OF CARRY
The cost of carry, c, is the storage cost plus the interest costs less 
the income earned
For an investment asset  F0 = S0ecT   
For a consumption asset  F0  S0ecT
The convenience yield on the consumption asset, y, is defined so 
that                      F0 = S0 e(c–y )T

US TREASURY MARKET
▪Deepest and most liquid government securities market in the world.
▪Serves as a means of financing the U.S. Federal Government.
▪Is a significant investment instrument and a hedging vehicle for global 
investors.
▪Is a benchmark for other financial instruments.
▪Important market for the Federal reserve’s implementation of monetary 
policy.
1

THE RISK -FREE RATE
The Treasury rate is considered to be artificially low because
Banks are not required to keep capital for Treasury instruments
Treasury instruments are given favorable tax treatment in the US
New reference rates such as SOFR are considered to be proxies for the risk -
free rate.
2

OVERNIGHT RATES
Unsecured borrowing and lending between banks as they 
adjust the reserve requirements they are required to 
keep with the central bank
Referred to as the Fed Funds Rate in the U.S. 
The effective fed funds rate is the volume weighted 
median of the rates on brokered transactions
Central bank may intervene with its own transactions to 
raise or lower the overnight rate
3

REPO
A sale of a security and an agreement to repurchase the security on a 
specified future date at a pre -arranged price. 
The seller of the security is the borrower of the cash and essentially 
obtains a collateralized loan.
The rate of interest is calculated from the difference between the sale 
price and the repurchase price and is the repo interest.
In the event the securities seller is unable to repurchase the securities, 
i.e. repay the loan, the cash provider is entitled to liquidate the 
securities to obtain repayment.
4

LIBOR
LIBOR is the rate of interest at which a AA -rated bank estimates it 
can  borrow money on an unsecured basis from another bank at 
11am. 
Several currencies and maturities
There have been some suggestions that banks manipulated LIBOR 
during certain periods. Why would they do this?
 
5

LIBOR PHASE OUT
Regulators phased out LIBOR by the end of 2021 and replaced it with 
rates based on transactions observed in the overnight market.
The new reference rates (e.g. for a 3 -month period) are calculated at 
the end of the period as the compounded overnight rates for that 
period.
6

THE NEW REFERENCE RATES
US dollar: SOFR (secured overnight financing rate)
GBP: SONIA (sterling overnight index average)
EU: ESTR (euro short -term rate)
Switzerland: SARON (Swiss average overnight rate)
Japan: TONAR (Tokyo average overnight rate) 
7

SOFR
SOFR is based on transaction data drawn from three segments of the repo 
market:
1) Tri-party Treasury general collateral (GC) repo transactions cleared 
and settled by the Bank of New York Mellon, excluding transactions made 
through the FICC GCF (General Collateral Financing) repo market and 
excluding transactions in which the Fed is a counterparty
2) Tri-party Treasury general collateral (GC) repo transactions made 
through the FICC GCF repo market, for which the FICC acts as central 
counterparty
3) Bilateral Treasury repo transactions cleared through the FICC DVP ( 
Delivery vs. Payment service)
8

GENERAL COLLATERAL
All tri -party repos, and some bilateral repos, are made against a pool of 
general collateral rather than specific securities. In a general collateral (GC) 
repo, the cash provider stipulates a population of acceptable collateral 
(Treasury securities), but does not stipulate the specific securities that the 
securities provider must pledge. 
9

TRI-PARTY REPO
▪ Uses a “tri -party” agent ( a custodian bank or clearing organization) to 
serve as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. 
▪ The collateral agent minimizes the operational burden in the transaction, 
prices the securities, holds the collateral separately from the dealer’s 
assets, layering in protection to the buyer in the event the dealer goes 
bankrupt.
10


FICC GCF REPO MARKET
▪ GCF Repo permits FICC’s netting members to trade cash and securities 
among themselves based on negotiated rates and terms. 
▪ Trades are completed on an anonymous basis through interdealer brokers.
▪ FICC acts as the central counterparty in a GCF Repo, serving as the legal 
counterparty to each side of the repo transaction.
11

BILATERAL REPO
▪ Counterparties exchange cash and securities without the use of a third 
party to manage collateral and facilitate centralized settlement. The 
parties may identify specific securities for their custodians to transfer. As a 
result, the bilateral repo market may contain transaction data for securities 
that trade “special” – i.e. cash providers may be willing to accept a lower 
return in order to secure a particular security.
▪ FRB NY ranks all FICC DVP bilateral repo trades by their transaction 
rates, from lowest to highest, and then removes 25% of the trading volume 
corresponding to the lowest transaction rates. The goal of this data filtering  
is to remove repo transactions in which treasury collateral is likely to be 
trading “special”, so as to achieve a residual set of bilateral repo data 
that largely reflects GC transactions. 
12

BILATERAL REPO 
▪ Bilateral repo transactions may be cleared or non -cleared
▪ Cleared : Specific form of tri -party repo in which an approved member 
of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) sponsors a non -dealer 
counterparty to transact on the FICC’s cleared repo platform. This platform 
settles through the Delivery Versus Payment settlement process, a method 
which permits the transfer of securities only after payment is made. 
▪ Non-cleared bilateral repo transactions do not settle on the clearing 
banks tri -party repo platforms and this segment is not used in SOFR 
calculations.
13

VOLUME WEIGHTED  MEDIAN
▪ FRB NY pools the three sources of data and then ranks the aggregate of 
repo trading volumes by their transaction rates, then computes the volume 
weighted median repo rate.  
▪ More robust statistic than a volume weighted average.
▪ The value it produces is an interest rate level that has actually been 
observed and at which business has been conducted.
▪ Aligns with the calculation method for the EFFR.
14

IMPACT OF COMPOUNDING
When we compound m times per year at rate R an amount  A 
grows to A(1+R/m)m  in one year
15Compounding frequency Value of $100 in one year at 10%
Annual (m=1) 110.00
Semiannual  (m=2) 110.25
Quarterly (m=4) 110.38
Monthly (m=12) 110.47
Weekly  (m=52) 110.51
Daily (m=365) 110.52

MEASURING INTEREST RATES
The compounding frequency used for an interest rate is 
the unit of measurement
The difference between quarterly and annual 
compounding is analogous to the difference between miles 
and kilometers
16

CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING
In the limit as we compound more and more 
frequently we obtain continuously compounded 
interest rates
$100 grows to $100 eRT when invested at a 
continuously compounded rate  R for time T
$100 received at time T discounts to $100 e-RT at 
time zero when the continuously compounded 
discount rate is R

quarterly compounding

ZERO RATES
A zero rate (or spot rate), for maturity T is the rate of interest 
earned on an investment that provides a payoff only at time T

DERIVATIVES VALUATION
▪The Binomial Asset Pricing model provides a powerful tool to 
understand arbitrage pricing theory and its relation to risk -neutral 
pricing.
▪The underlying assumption is that the asset follows a random walk. 
In each time step, the asset has a certain probability of moving up by 
a certain percentage amount and a certain probability of moving 
down by a certain percentage amount. 
▪In the limit, as the time step becomes smaller, this model leads to 
the lognormal assumption for stock prices that underlies the Black -
Scholes model.

Another expression for the portfolio value today is S0D – f
Hence 
   ƒ = S0D – (S0uD – ƒu )e–rT

‘P’ AS A PROBABILITY
It is natural to interpret p and 1 -p as probabilities of up

The value of a derivative is then its expected payoff in a 
risk-neutral world discounted at the risk -free rate

RISK -NEUTRAL VALUATION
When the probability of an up and down movements 
are p and 1 -p the expected stock price at time T is 
S0erT
This shows that the stock price earns the risk -free 
rate
Binomial trees illustrate the general result that to 
value a derivative we can assume that the expected 
return on the underlying asset is the risk -free rate 
and discount at the risk -free rate
This is known as using risk -neutral valuation

AN EXAMPLE
A stock price is currently $20
In 3 months it will be either $22 or $18
7Stock Price = $18Stock Price = $22
Stock price = $20

A CALL OPTION
A 3-month call option on the stock has a strike 
price of 21. 
 
8Stock Price = $18
Option Payoff = $0Stock Price = $22
Option Payoff = $1
Stock price = $20

SETTING UP A RISKLESS PORTFOLIO
For a  portfolio that is long D shares and a short 1 
call option values are      
       
       
       
       
       
Portfolio is riskless when  22 D – 1 = 18 D  or  D = 0.25
922D – 1
18D

VALUING THE PORTFOLIO
(RISK -FREE RATE IS 4%)
The riskless portfolio is: 
  long 0.25 shares     
  short 1 call option
The value of the portfolio in 3 months is 
  22 ×0.25 – 1 = 4.50
The value of the portfolio today is 
  4.5 e–0.04×0.25 = 4.455
10

VALUING THE OPTION
The portfolio that is 
  long  0.25 shares     
  short  1 option    
     is worth 4.455
The value of the shares is    
 5.000 (= 0.25 × 20 )
The value of the option is therefore   
  5.000 – 4.455 = 0.545
11

ORIGINAL EXAMPLE REVISITED
        
        
    
 p is the probability that gives a return on the stock equal to the risk -

IRRELEVANCE OF STOCK’S EXPECTED 
RETURN
When we are valuing an option in terms of the price 
of the underlying asset, the probability of up and 
down movements in the real world are irrelevant
This is an example of a more general result stating 
that the expected return on the underlying asset in 
the real world is irrelevant 
Therefore, we could move from a world with one set of risk 
preferences to another (risk -neutral) world with another set of 
risk preferences. This process is called ‘changing the 
measure’. 
14

DELTA
Delta ( D) is the ratio of the change in the price of a stock 
option to the change in the price of the underlying stock
The value of D varies from node to node
i.e the Portfolio needs to be rebalanced at each time step in 
order to stay risk neutral.
15

CHOOSING U AND D
One way of matching the volatility is to set
 
 where s is the volatility and  Dt is the length of the time step. 
This is the approach used by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein

GIRSANOV’S THEOREM
Volatility is the same in the real world and the risk -neutral world
We can therefore measure volatility in the real world and use it 
to build a tree for the an asset in the risk -neutral world

MARKOV PROCESSES
Markov process : A type of stochastic process where only the 
present value of a variable is relevant for predicting the future. 
Stock prices are assumed to follow a Markov process.
1

MARKOV PROCESSES
Consider a variable, x
Change in the value of x in 1 year follows a normal distribution 
with mean 0 and variance 1
What is the probability distribution of the change in x at the end 
of 2 years?
½ years?      
Dt years?

VARIANCES & STANDARD DEVIATIONS
In Markov processes changes in successive periods of time 
are independent
This means that variances are additive
Standard deviations are not additive

A WIENER PROCESS
A type of Markov process with a mean rate of change of 
zero and a variance rate of change of 1 per year. 
In physics, describes the motion of a particle that is 
subject to a large number of small molecular shocks and 
is referred to as Brownian Motion. 
A variable z follows a Wiener process if
 The change in z in a small interval of time Dt  is Dz   
  
 The values of Dz  for any 2 different (non -overlapping) periods of time 
are independent.

GENERALIZED WIENER PROCESSES
A Wiener process has a drift rate (i.e. average change per unit 
time) of 0 and a variance rate of 1
In a generalized Wiener process the drift rate and the variance 
rate can be set equal to any chosen constants
Mean change in x per unit time is a
Variance of change in x per unit time is b2

ITÔ PROCESS
In an Itô process the drift rate and the variance rate are

THE CONCEPTS  UNDERLYING BLACK -
SCHOLES -MERTON
The option price and the stock price depend on the 
same underlying source of uncertainty
We can form a portfolio consisting of the stock and the 
option which eliminates this source of uncertainty
The portfolio is instantaneously riskless and must 
instantaneously earn the risk -free rate
This leads to the Black -Scholes -Merton differential 
equation

RISK -NEUTRAL VALUATION
The variable m does not  appear in the Black -Scholes -Merton 
differential equation
The equation is independent of all variables affected by risk 
preference
The solution to the differential equation is therefore the same in a 
risk-free world as it is in the real world
This leads to the principle of risk -neutral valuation
24

APPLYING RISK -NEUTRAL VALUATION
1. Assume that the expected return from the stock 
price is the risk -free rate
2. Calculate the expected payoff from the option
3. Discount at the risk -free rate

 −8000+2.0 w1 +1.2 w2 =0
to get w1 = 400 and w2 = 6000 to make the portfolio gamma and vega 
neutral. We require long positions of 400 and 6000 in option 1 and option 
2. A short position of 3240 in the asset is then required to make the 
portfolio delta neutral

REASONS FOR SMILE IN EQUITY OPTIONS
There is a negative correlation between equity prices and volatility. 
Possible reasons:
Leverage
Volatility feedback
Flight to quality
When the price decreases (increases), volatility tends to increase 
(decrease) making further decreases (increases) more (less) likely

VOLATILITY TERM STRUCTURE
In addition to calculating a volatility smile, traders also 
calculate a volatility term structure
This shows the variation of implied volatility with the time to 
maturity of the option
The volatility term structure tends to be downward sloping 
when volatility is high and upward sloping when it is low
13

VOLATILITY SURFACE
The implied volatility as a function of the strike price and time 
to maturity is known as a volatility surface

PRINCIPAL PROTECTED NOTE
Allows investor to take a risky position without risking any 
principal
Example: 
Suppose that the 3 -year interest rate is 6% with continuous compounding. 
This means that $835 .27 will grow to $1,000 in 3 years. The difference 
between $1,000 and $835.27 is $164.73. Suppose that a stock portfolio is 
worth $1,000 and provides a dividend yield of 1.5% per annum. Suppose 
further that a 3 -year at -the-money European call option on the stock 
portfolio can be purchased for less than $164.73.

BOX SPREAD
A combination of a bull call spread and a bear put spread
If all options are European a box spread is worth the present 
value of the difference between the strike prices
If they are American this is not necessarily so.

OTHER PAYOFF PATTERNS
When the strike prices are close together a butterfly spread 
provides a payoff consisting of a small “spike”
If options with all strike prices were available any payoff pattern 
could (at least approximately) be created by combining the 
spikes obtained from different butterfly spreads
