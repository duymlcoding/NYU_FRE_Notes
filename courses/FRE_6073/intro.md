# Introduction to Derivatives

## Course Overview

Welcome to FRE 6073: Introduction to Derivatives. This course provides a comprehensive foundation in derivative securities, covering the fundamental principles, pricing models, and risk management techniques essential for modern financial engineering.

## What You Will Learn

This course explores the theory and practice of derivative securities, including:

- **Fundamental Concepts**: Understanding what derivatives are, why they matter, and how they're used in financial markets
- **Forward and Futures Contracts**: Mechanics, pricing, and applications of these fundamental derivatives
- **Options**: Call and put options, American vs European options, and their strategic uses
- **Pricing Models**: From binomial trees to the Black-Scholes-Merton framework
- **Risk Management**: The Greeks and their applications in hedging and portfolio management
- **Market Practices**: Trading venues, clearing mechanisms, and regulatory frameworks

## Course Structure

The course is organized into 10 comprehensive chapters:
